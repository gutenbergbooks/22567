CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
RESULTS OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR<br>
<br>
[1763]<br>
<br>
The results of the French and Indian War were out of all proportion to<br>
the scale of its military operations. Contrasted with the campaigns<br>
which were then shaking all Europe, it sank into insignificance; and the<br>
world, its eyes strained to see the magnitude and the issue of those<br>
European wars, little surmised that they would dictate the course of<br>
history far less than yonder desultory campaigning in America. Yet here<br>
and there a political prophet foresaw some of these momentous indirect<br>
consequences of the war. "England will erelong repent," said Vergennes,<br>
then the French ambassador at Constantinople, "of having removed the<br>
only check that could keep her colonies in awe. They no longer stand in<br>
need of her protection. She will call on them to contribute toward<br>
supporting the burdens they have helped to bring upon her, and they will<br>
answer by striking off all dependence." This is, in outline, the history<br>
of the next twenty years.<br>
<br>
The war in Europe and America had been a heavy drain upon the treasury<br>
of England. Her national debt had doubled, amounting at the conclusion<br>
of peace to 140,000,000 Pounds sterling. The Government naturally<br>
desired to lay upon its American subjects a portion of this burden,<br>
which had been incurred partly on their behalf. The result was that new<br>
system of taxation which the king and his ministers sought to impose<br>
upon the colonies, and which was the immediate cause of the Revolution.<br>
The hated taxes cannot, of course, be traced to the French and Indian<br>
War alone as their source. England had for years shown a growing purpose<br>
to get revenue out of her American dependencies; but the debt incurred<br>
by the war gave an animus and a momentum to this policy which carried it<br>
forward in the face of opposition that might otherwise have warned even<br>
George III. to pause ere it was too late.<br>
<br>
[1765]<br>
<br>
While the war thus indirectly led England to encroach upon the rights of<br>
the colonies, it also did much to prepare the latter to resist such<br>
encroachment. It had this effect mainly in two ways: by promoting union<br>
among the colonies, and by giving to many of their citizens a good<br>
training in the duties of camp, march, and battle-field.<br>
<br>
The value to the colonists of their military experience in this war can<br>
hardly be overestimated. If the outbreak of the Revolution had found the<br>
Americans a generation of civilians, if the colonial cause had lacked<br>
the privates who had seen hard service at Lake George and Louisburg, or<br>
the officers, such as Washington, Gates, Montgomery, Stark, and Putnam,<br>
who had learned to fight successfully against British regulars by<br>
fighting with them, it is a question whether the uprising would not have<br>
been stamped out, for a time at least, almost at its inception.<br>
Especially at the beginning of such a war, when the first necessity is<br>
to get a peaceful nation under arms as quickly as possible, a few<br>
soldier-citizens are invaluable. They form the nucleus of the rising<br>
army, and set the standard for military organization and discipline. In<br>
fact, the French and Indian War would have repaid the colonies all it<br>
cost even if its only result had been to give the youthful Washington<br>
that schooling in arms which helped fit him to command the Continental<br>
armies. Without the Washington of Fort Necessity and of Braddock's<br>
defeat, we could in all likelihood never have had the Washington of<br>
Trenton and Yorktown. Besides Washington, to say nothing of Gates, Gage,<br>
and Mercer, also there, Dan Morgan, of Virginia, began to learn war in<br>
the Braddock campaign.<br>
<br>

Bloody Pond, near Lake George, which is said to still contain the<br>
bones of many of those who fell in the fight at Fort William Henry.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, the war prepared the colonists for the Revolution by revealing to<br>
them their own rare fighting quality, and by showing that the dreaded<br>
British regulars were not invincible. No foe would, at Saratoga or<br>
Monmouth, see the backs of the men who had covered the redcoats' retreat<br>
from the field of Braddock's death, scaled the abatis of Louisburg, or<br>
brained Dieskau's regulars on the parapet of Fort William Henry.<br>
<br>
But there was one thing even more necessary to the Revolutionists than<br>
skill at arms, and that was union. Their only hope of successful<br>
resistance against the might of England lay in concerted action, and<br>
perhaps the most important result of the long war through which they had<br>
been passing was the sense of union and of a common cause with which it<br>
had inspired the thirteen colonies. This feeling was of course still<br>
none too intense. But during the long war the colonies had drawn nearer<br>
to one another than ever before. Soldiers from New Hampshire and North<br>
Carolina, from Virginia and Massachusetts, bivouacked together, and<br>
fought shoulder to shoulder. Colonial officers forgot local jealousies<br>
in a common resentment of the contempt and neglect shown them all alike<br>
by the haughty subalterns of the king. Mutual good-will was fostered by<br>
the money and troops which the southern and less exposed colonies sent<br>
to their sister commonwealths on the frontier. In these and numberless<br>
minor ways a community of sentiment was engendered which, imperfect as<br>
it was, yet prepared the way for that hearty co-operation which was to<br>
carry the infant States through the fiery trial just before them.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember, as well, not only that the war built up<br>
this conviction of a common interest, but that nothing except the war<br>
could have done it. The great forces of nineteenth-century<br>
civilization--the locomotive, the telegraph, the modern daily<br>
newspaper--which now bind sixty millions of people, spread over half a<br>
continent, into one nation, were then unknown. The means of<br>
communication and transportation between the colonies were very<br>
primitive. Roads were rough, full of steeps and cuts, and in many<br>
places, especially near cities, almost impassable with mire. It took<br>
seven days to go by stage from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, four days<br>
from Boston to New York. The mail service was correspondingly inadequate<br>
and slow. At times in winter a letter would be five weeks in going from<br>
Philadelphia to Virginia. The newspapers were few, contained little<br>
news, and the circulation of each was necessarily confined to a very<br>
limited area. It has been estimated that the reading-matter in all the<br>
forty-three papers which existed at the close of the Revolution would<br>
not fill ten pages of the New York Herald now. In connection with this<br>
state of things consider the fact that the idea of colonial solidarity<br>
had not then, as now, merely to be sustained. It had to be created<br>
outright. Local pride and jealousy were still strong. Each colony had<br>
thought of itself as a complete and isolated political body, in a way<br>
which it is difficult for us, after a hundred years of national unity,<br>
to conceive. Plainly a lifetime of peace would not have begotten the<br>
same degree of consolidation among the colonies which the war, with its<br>
common danger and common purpose, called into being in a half-dozen<br>
years.<br>
<br>
The war did yet another important service by removing a dangerous<br>
neighbor of the colonies. So long as France, ambitious and warlike, kept<br>
foot-hold in the New World, the colonies had to look to the<br>
mother-country for protection. But this danger gone, England ceased to<br>
be necessary to the safety of the embryo political communities, and her<br>
sovereignty was therefore the more readily renounced. English statesmen<br>
foresaw this danger before the Peace of Paris, and but for the<br>
magnanimity of Pitt our western territory might after all have been left<br>
in the hands of France.<br>
<br>
And the cession of Canada, besides removing an enemy, helped to<br>
transform that enemy into an active friend. Had France retained her<br>
possessions in America, she would still have had an interest in<br>
maintaining the colonial system, and it is doubtful if even her hatred<br>
of England would have induced her to aid the rebellious colonies. But,<br>
her dream of a great Western empire forever dispelled, she had much to<br>
gain and nothing to lose by drawing sword for the American cause. The<br>
British defeated the French at Quebec only to meet them again at<br>
Yorktown.<br>
<br>
One more result remains to be noted, without which what has preceded<br>
would lose half its significance. By the Peace of Paris England<br>
succeeded to all of France's possessions in America east of the<br>
Mississippi; but the most valuable part of this great territory she won<br>
only to hold in trust a few years for her colonial children. The<br>
redcoats under Amherst and Wolfe, who thought they were fighting for<br>
King George, were in reality winning an empire for the Young Republic.<br>
It is not easy to feel the full significance of this. The colonies<br>
might, indeed, have won independence even if France had retained her<br>
grasp on the valley of the Mississippi; but so long as the new-born<br>
nation was shut up to a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast, it would<br>
have been a lion caged. The "conquest of Canada," says Green, "by ...<br>
flinging open to their energies in the days to come the boundless plains<br>
of the West, laid the foundation of the United States."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
GEORGE III. AND HIS AMERICAN COLONIES<br>
<br>
[1760]<br>
<br>
The year after the capture of Quebec a young king ascended the throne of<br>
England, whose action was to affect profoundly the fortunes of the<br>
American colonies. Of narrow mental range and plebeian tastes, but<br>
moral, sincere, and stout-hearted, George III. assumed the crown with<br>
one dominant purpose--to rule personally; and the first decade of his<br>
reign was a constant struggle to free himself from the dictation of<br>
cabinet ministers. In 1770, during the premiership of North, who was<br>
little more than his page, the king gained the day; and for the next<br>
dozen years he had his own way perfectly. All points of policy, foreign<br>
and domestic, even the management of debates in Parliament, he was<br>
crafty enough to get into his hands. To this meddling of his with state<br>
affairs, his impracticable and fickle plans, and the stupidity of the<br>
admirers whom his policy forced upon him, may be traced in very large<br>
measure the breach between England and the colonies.<br>
<br>
The Revolution, however, cannot be wholly accounted for by any series of<br>
events which can be set down and labelled. The ultimate causes lie<br>
deeper. Three thousand miles of ocean rolled between England and the<br>
colonies. A considerable measure of colonial self-government was<br>
inevitable from the first, and this, by fostering the spirit of<br>
independence, created a demand for more and more freedom. The social<br>
ties which had bound the early Pilgrims to their native land grew<br>
steadily weaker with each new generation of people who knew no home but<br>
America. The colonists had begun to feel the stirrings of an independent<br>
national life. The boundless possibilities of the future on this new<br>
continent, with its immense territory and untold natural wealth, were<br>
beginning to dawn upon them. Their infancy was over. The leading-strings<br>
which bound them to the mother-country must be either lengthened or cast<br>
off altogether.<br>
<br>

King George III.<br>
<br>
<br>
But England did not see this. Most Englishmen at the beginning of George<br>
III.'s reign regarded the colonies as trading corporations rather than<br>
as political bodies. It was taken for granted that a colony was inferior<br>
to the mother-country, and was to be managed in the interests of the<br>
commercial classes at home. Conflict was therefore inevitable sooner or<br>
later. We have to trace briefly the chief events by which it was<br>
precipitated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 501px; height: 609px;" alt=""

James Otis, Jr.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1764]<br>
<br>
In 1760-61 England tried to enforce the navigation laws more strictly.<br>
Writs of assistance issued, empowering officers to enter any house at<br>
any time, to search for smuggled goods. This measure aroused a storm of<br>
indignation. The popular feeling was voiced, and at the same time<br>
intensified, by the action of James Otis, Jr., a young Boston lawyer,<br>
who threw up his position as advocate-general rather than defend the<br>
hated writs, which he denounced as "instruments of slavery." "Then and<br>
there," said John Adams, "the trumpet of the Revolution was sounded."<br>
<br>
In May, 1764, a report reached Boston that a stamp act for the colonies<br>
had been proposed in Parliament, to raise revenue by forcing the use in<br>
America of stamped forms for all sorts of public papers, such as deeds,<br>
warrants, and the like. A feeling of mingled rage and alarm seized the<br>
colonists. It seemed that a deliberate blow was about to be struck at<br>
their liberties. From the day of their founding the colonies had never<br>
been taxed directly except by their own legislatures. Massachusetts, New<br>
York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia at once sent<br>
humble but earnest protests to Parliament against the proposed<br>
innovation.<br>
<br>
The act was nevertheless passed in March of the next year, with almost<br>
no opposition. By its provisions, business documents were illegal and<br>
void unless written on the stamped paper. The cheapest stamp cost a<br>
shilling, the price ranging upward from that according to the importance<br>
of the document. The prepared paper had to be paid for in specie, a<br>
hardship indeed in a community where lawsuits were very common, and<br>
whose entire solid coin would not have sufficed to pay the revenue for a<br>
single year. Even bitterest Tories' declared this requirement<br>
indefensible. Another flagrant feature of the act was the provision that<br>
violators of it should be tried without a jury, before a judge whose<br>
only pay came from his own condemnations.<br>
<br>
<br>

 src="images/037Pic_600_25.jpg"><br>
Burning the Stamps in New York.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1765]<br>
<br>
The effect upon the colonies was like that of a bomb in a<br>
powder-magazine. The people rose up en masse. In every province the<br>
stamp-distributor was compelled to resign. In Portsmouth, N. H., the<br>
newspaper came out in mourning, and an effigy of the Goddess of Liberty<br>
was carried to the grave. The Connecticut legislature ordered a day of<br>
fasting and prayer kept, and an inventory of powder and ball taken. In<br>
New York a bonfire was made of the stamps in the public square. The<br>
bells in Charleston, S. C., were tolled, and the flags on the ships in<br>
the harbor hung at half-mast. The colonists entered into agreements to<br>
buy no goods from England until the act was repealed. Even mourning<br>
clothes, since they must be imported, were not to be worn, and lamb's<br>
flesh was abjured that more wool might be raised for home manufacture.<br>
England's colonial trade fell off so alarmingly in consequence that<br>
Manchester manufacturers petitioned Parliament to repeal the act,<br>
asserting that nine-tenths of their workmen were idle. Besides these<br>
popular demonstrations, delegates from nine colonies met in New York, in<br>
October, 1765, often called the Stamp Act Congress, and adopted a<br>
declaration of rights, asserting that England had no right to tax them<br>
without their consent. During the days of the Stamp Act excitement, the<br>
term "colonist" gave way to "American," and "English" to "British," a<br>
term of the deeper opprobrium because Bute, the king's chief adviser,<br>
was a Briton.<br>
<br>
Startled by this unexpected resistance, Parliament, in January of the<br>
next year, began to debate repeal. We must in fairness to England look<br>
at both sides of the problem of colonial taxation. As general<br>
administrator of colonial affairs, the English Government naturally<br>
desired a fixed and certain revenue in America, both for frontier<br>
defence against Indians and French and for the payment of colonial<br>
governors.&nbsp; While each stood ready to defend its own territory, the<br>
colonies were no doubt meanly slow about contributing to any common<br>
fund. They were frequently at loggerheads, too, with their governors<br>
over the question of salaries. On the other hand, the colonists made the<br>
strong plea that self-taxation was their only safeguard against tyranny<br>
of king, Parliament, or governor.<br>
<br>
In the great debate which now ensued in Parliament over England's right<br>
to tax America, Mansfield, the greatest constitutional lawyer of his<br>
day, maintained--first, that America was represented in Parliament as<br>
much as Manchester and several other large cities in England which<br>
elected no members to the House of Commons, and yet were taxed; and,<br>
second, that an internal tax, such as that on stamps, was identical in<br>
principle with customs duties, which the colonies had never resisted. In<br>
reply, Pitt, the great champion of the colonies, asserted--first, that<br>
the case of the colonies was not at all like that of Manchester; the<br>
latter happened not to be represented at that time because the election<br>
laws needed reforming, while the colonies, being three thousand miles<br>
away, could in the nature of the case never be adequately represented in<br>
an English Parliament; and, second, that as a matter of fact a sharp<br>
distinction had always, since the Great Charter, been made between<br>
internal taxation and customs duties.<br>
<br>
Had the colonies rested their case upon constitutional argument alone it<br>
would have been relatively weak. While it was then a question, and will<br>
be forever, whether the American settlements were king's colonies,<br>
Parliament's colonies, or neither, but peculiar communities which had<br>
resulted from growth, the English lawyers had a good deal of logic on<br>
their side. Unconstitutional measures had indeed been resorted to--the<br>
writs of assistance, taking Americans beyond sea for trial, internal<br>
taxation; yet the real grievance lay far less in these things than in<br>
the fact that the English constitution itself was working in a manner<br>
contrary to colonial interests. Social considerations, too, accounted<br>
for more bitterness than has usually been thought. Our fathers hated the<br>
presence here of a privileged class.<br>
<br>
George III.'s policy was therefore wiser legally than politically. This<br>
was, in fact, his ministry's capital mistake--like Lord Salisbury's in<br>
respect to Ireland in 1888--that it had too great regard for the mere<br>
legal aspect of the question, ignoring the practical. The colonists were<br>
too numerous, powerful, and far away, longer to be governed from home,<br>
at least by the old plan. To attempt perpetuation of the old regime<br>
might be lawful, but was certainly impracticable and stupid. Hence<br>
Americans like Jefferson showed themselves consummate politicians in<br>
going beyond Pitt's contention from the constitution and from precedent,<br>
and appealing to the "natural rights" of the colonists. "Our rights,"<br>
said Otis, in substance, "do not rest on a charter, but are inherent in<br>
us as men." "The people" said John Adams in 1765, "have rights<br>
antecedent to all earthly government."<br>
<br>
[1767]<br>
<br>
The Stamp Act was repealed in February. Its principle, however, was<br>
immediately re-asserted by the "Declaratory Act," in which Parliament<br>
claimed power over the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." The repeal<br>
caused great rejoicing in America; but neither king nor Parliament had<br>
changed policy respecting colonial affairs. There soon followed, in<br>
rapid succession, that series of blundering acts of oppression which<br>
completed the work begun by the Stamp Act, and drove the colonists into<br>
rebellion.<br>
<br>
In 1767 duties were laid upon glass, paper, painters' colors, and tea.<br>
Massachusetts, again taking the lead, sent a circular-letter to all the<br>
colonies, proposing a united supplication to the throne. For refusal to<br>
rescind this letter the Massachusetts assembly was dissolved at the<br>
command of the angry king. This refusal was the first denial of the<br>
king's prerogative; only the authority of Parliament had been resisted<br>
before. The soul of the colonial cause in Massachusetts at this time was<br>
Samuel Adams, of Boston, "the last of the Puritans," a man of powerful<br>
and logical mind, intrepid heart, and incorruptible patriotism.<br>
America's debt to him for his work in these early years cannot be<br>
estimated. At this juncture he organized committees of safety and<br>
correspondence throughout Massachusetts, which led to the formation of<br>
such committees in the other colonies. They did an invaluable work in<br>
binding the scattered sections together, and providing for emergencies.<br>
<br>
[1768]<br>
<br>
The Billeting Act, which required the colonists to lodge and feed the<br>
British troops quartered among them, added fuel to the flames. In 1768<br>
the New York legislature refused to comply, and Parliament suspended its<br>
legislative functions.<br>
<br>
[1770]<br>
<br>
In the fall of the same year, seizing as a pretext two ship-riots which<br>
had occurred in the summer, the king stationed four regiments in Boston.<br>
Public sentiment was shocked and indignant at this establishment of a<br>
military guard over a peaceable community. The presence of the soldiers<br>
was a constant source of irritation. Frequent altercations occurred<br>
between the soldiers and the lower class of citizens. The trouble<br>
culminated in the Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770. A squad of soldiers,<br>
set upon by a mob of men and boys, fired into the crowd, killing three<br>
persons and wounding eight others. That the soldiers had considerable<br>
justification is proved by the fact that a jury acquitted all but two,<br>
who were convicted of manslaughter, and branded. But exaggerated reports<br>
of the occurrence spread like wildfire throughout the colonies, and<br>
wrought powerfully for hatred against England.<br>
<br>
[1772]<br>
<br>
During the next two or three years there was comparative quiet.<br>
Massachusetts, it is true, under the tutelage of Samuel Adams, grew more<br>
radical in its demands. In 1772 the committee of Boston issued a<br>
statement of grievances, adding, as new complaints, the sending of<br>
persons to England for trial, restraints upon colonial manufacturers,<br>
and a rumored plan to establish bishops over America. This statement was<br>
approved by all the colonies, and was sent to Franklin in London. The<br>
country as a whole, however, was weary of the strife, and would gladly<br>
have returned to the old cordial relations with the mother-land.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
[1773]<br>
<br>
But George III. could not rest without asserting his supremacy over<br>
America. He made an arrangement with the East India Company by which tea<br>
could be bought in America, spite of the hated tax, cheaper than in<br>
England. Then, at the king's instigation, large shipments of tea were<br>
made to America. The colonists saw through the cunning attempt, and the<br>
tide of resistance rose higher than ever. At New York and Philadelphia<br>
the tea-ships were forced to put to sea again without unlading. At<br>
Charleston the tea was stored in damp cellars and soon spoiled. At<br>
Boston there was a deadlock; the people would not let the tea be landed;<br>
the governor would not let the ships sail without unlading. On the<br>
evening of December 16, 1773, the tax falling due on the next day, a<br>
party of fifty citizens, disguised as Indians, boarded the ships, and<br>
threw three hundred and forty-two chests of tea into the harbor.<br>
<br>
[1774]<br>
<br>
The Boston tea-party aroused all the blind obstinacy of George III.<br>
"Blows must decide," he exclaimed; "the guilty rebels are to be forced<br>
to submission," The king's anger led to the Boston Port Bill, which was<br>
passed the next year, and closed Boston harbor to all commerce. Changes<br>
were also made in the government of Massachusetts, rendering it almost<br>
entirely independent of the people. Town meetings were forbidden except<br>
for elections. Poor Massachusetts, her liberties curtailed, her commerce<br>
ruined, appealed to her sister colonies for support, and they responded<br>
right heartily. In three weeks from the news of the Port Bill all the<br>
colonies had made the cause of Massachusetts their own. Expressions of<br>
sympathy and liberal gifts of money and provisions poured into Boston<br>
from all over the country. The first Continental Congress assembled at<br>
Philadelphia in September. All the colonies but Georgia were<br>
represented. An earnest statement of grievances was drawn up, with a<br>
prayer to the king for redress. The action of Massachusetts was<br>
approved, and an agreement entered into to suspend all commerce with<br>
England.<br>
<br>
Things now hastened rapidly toward open war. British troops were<br>
stationed in Boston, and began fortification. Military preparations were<br>
making everywhere among the colonists. The train was laid. Only a spark<br>
was needed to bring the dreaded explosion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
INDEPENDENCE AND THE NEW STATES<br>
<br>
[1775]<br>
<br>
The thought of independence in the minds of the colonists was of<br>
surprisingly slow growth. The feeling of dependence on the<br>
mother-country and of loyalty to the king was deep-rooted and died hard.<br>
Even union, which was a pre-requisite to a successful struggle for<br>
independence, came slowly. The old New England Confederation, in 1643-<br>
84, between Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven, for<br>
defence against Indians, Dutch, and French, ended without ever having<br>
manifested the slightest vigor. In the latter half of the seventeenth<br>
century Virginia had alliances with some sister colonies for protection<br>
against Indians; but there was no call for a general congress until the<br>
French and Indian attack on Schenectady, in 1690, during King William's<br>
War. Representatives from New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and<br>
Plymouth met that year at New York; letters came from Virginia,<br>
Maryland, and Rhode Island. But no permanent union was proposed here,<br>
nor at any of the similar meetings, seven at least, which occurred<br>
between 1690 and 1750.<br>
<br>
The Albany Convention, which met in 1754 to prepare for the French and<br>
Indian War, adopted a plan for union presented by Franklin, providing<br>
for a president-general appointed and supported by the Crown, and for a<br>
grand council of delegates elected triennially by the colonies according<br>
to population, and empowered, within limits, to lay taxes and make laws<br>
for the common interest of English America. Franklin believed that the<br>
adoption of this scheme would have postponed the Revolution a century.<br>
But, as it gave so much power to the king, it was rejected by the people<br>
in every colony.<br>
<br>
Even after English oppression and the diligent agency of committees of<br>
correspondence had brought union, and delegates from the colonies had<br>
met again and again in Congress, the thought of breaking away from the<br>
mother-land was strange to the minds of nearly all. The instructions to<br>
the delegates to the first Congress, in September, 1774, gave no<br>
suggestion of independence.&nbsp; On the contrary, colony after colony
urged<br>
its representatives to seek the restoration of "harmony and union" with<br>
England. This Congress branded as "calumny" the charge that it wished<br>
"independency." Washington wrote, from the Congress, that independence<br>
was then not "desired by any thinking man in America."<br>
<br>

ON ME".</big></big><br>
<big><big><br>
<br>
The feeling was much the same in 1775. Pennsylvania "strictly" commanded<br>
her representatives to dissent from any "proposition that may lead to<br>
separation." Maryland gave similar instructions in January, 1776.<br>
Independence was neither the avowed nor the conscious object in<br>
defending Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775. Washington's commission as<br>
commander-in-chief, two days later, gave no hint of it. And the New<br>
Hampshire legislature so late as December 25, 1775, in the very act of<br>
framing a new state government, "totally disavowed" all such aim. In the<br>
fall of 1775 Congress declared that it had "not raised armies with the<br>
ambitious design of separation from Great Britain."<br>
<br>
The swift change which, a little more than six months later, made the<br>
Declaration of Independence possible and even popular, has never yet<br>
been fully explained. In May, 1775, John Adams had been cautioned by the<br>
Philadelphia Sons of Liberty not to utter the word independence. "It is<br>
as unpopular," they said, in "Pennsylvania and all the Middle and<br>
Southern States as the Stamp Act itself."&nbsp; Early in 1776 this same
great<br>
man wrote that there was hardly a newspaper in America but openly<br>
advocated independence. In the spring of 1776 the conservative<br>
Washington declared, "Reconciliation is impracticable. Nothing but<br>
independence will save us." Statesmen began to see that longer delay was<br>
dangerous, that permanent union turned upon independence, and that,<br>
without a government of their own, people would by and by demand back<br>
their old constitution, as the English did after Cromwell's death. "The<br>
country is not only ripe for independence," said Witherspoon, of New<br>
Jersey, debating in Congress, "but is in danger of becoming rotten for<br>
lack of it."<br>
<br>
Colony after colony now came rapidly into line. Massachusetts gave<br>
instructions to her delegates in Congress, virtually favoring<br>
independence, in January, 1776. Georgia did the same in February, South<br>
Carolina in March. Express authority to "concur in independency" came<br>
first from North Carolina, April 12th, and the following May 31st<br>
Mecklenburg County in that State explicitly declared its independence of<br>
England. On May 1st Massachusetts began to disuse the king's name in<br>
public instruments. May 4th, Rhode Island renounced allegiance almost in<br>
terms. On May 15th brave old Virginia ordered her delegates in Congress<br>
to bite right into the sour apple and propose independence. Connecticut,<br>
New Hampshire, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania took action in the<br>
same direction during the following month.<br>
<br>

Union Flag. The first recognized Continental Standard, raised for the<br>
first time January 2,1776.<br>
<br>
The king's brutal attitude had much to do with this sudden change. The<br>
colonists had nursed the belief that the king was misled by his<br>
ministers. A last petition, couched in respectful terms, was drawn up by<br>
Congress in the summer of 1775, and sent to England. Out of respect to<br>
the feelings of good John Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, who still clung to<br>
England, this address was tempered with a submissiveness which offended<br>
many members. On its being read, Dickinson remarked that but one word in<br>
it displeased him, the word "Congress;" to which Colonel Ben Harrison,<br>
of Virginia, retorted that but one word in it pleased him, and that<br>
"Congress" was precisely the word.<br>
<br>
The appeal was idle. The king's only answer was a violent proclamation<br>
denouncing the Americans as rebels. It was learned at the same time that<br>
he was preparing to place Indians, negroes, and German mercenaries in<br>
arms against them. The truth was forced upon the most reluctant, that<br>
the root of England's obduracy was in the king personally, and that<br>
further supplications were useless. The surprising success of the<br>
colonial arms, the shedding of blood at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker<br>
Hill--all which, remember, antedated the Declaration--the increase and<br>
the ravages of the royal army and navy in America, were all efficient in<br>
urging the colonists to break utterly and forever from the<br>
mother-country.<br>
<br>
[1772]<br>
<br>
The behavior of the Gaspe officers in Narragansett Bay, their illegal<br>
seizures, plundering expeditions on shore, and wanton manners in<br>
stopping and searching boats, illustrate the spirit of the king's<br>
hirelings in America at this time. At last the Rhode Islanders could<br>
endure it no longer. Early on the morning of June 9, 1772, Captain<br>
Abraham Whipple, with a few boatloads of trusty aides, dropped down the<br>
river from Providence to what is now called Gaspe Point, six or seven<br>
miles below the city, where the offending craft had run aground the<br>
previous evening in giving chase to the Newport-Providence packet-boat,<br>
and after a spirited fight mastered the Gaspe's company, put them on<br>
shore, and burned the ship. There would be much propriety in dating the<br>
Revolution from this daring act.<br>
<br>
[1774]<br>
<br>
Nor was this the only case of Rhode Island's forwardness in the<br>
struggle. December 5, 1774, her General Assembly ordered Colonel<br>
Nightingale to remove to Providence all the cannon and ammunition of<br>
Fort George, except three guns, and this was done before the end of the<br>
next day. More than forty cannon, with much powder and shot, were thus<br>
husbanded for service to come. News of this was carried to New<br>
Hampshire, and resulted in the capture of Fort William and Mary at New<br>
Castle, December 14, 1774, which some have referred to as the opening<br>
act of the Revolution. This deed was accomplished by fourteen men from<br>
Durham, who entered the fort at night when the officers were at a ball<br>
in Portsmouth. The powder which they captured is said to have done duty<br>
at Bunker Hill.<br>
<br>
[1776]<br>
<br>
Most potent of all as a cause of the resolution to separate was Thomas<br>
Paine's pamphlet, "Common Sense," published in January, 1776, and<br>
circulated widely throughout the colonies. Its lucid style, its homely<br>
way of putting things, and its appeals to Scripture must have given it<br>
at any rate a strong hold upon the masses of the people. It was doubly<br>
and trebly triumphant from the fact that it voiced, in clear, bold<br>
terms, a long-growing popular conviction of the propriety of<br>
independence, stronger than men had dared to admit even to themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>

Thomas Paine.<br>
<br>
<br>
On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, rose in Congress, and,<br>
in obedience to the command of his State, moved a resolution "that the<br>
united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent<br>
States." John Adams seconded the motion. It led to great debate, which<br>
evinced that New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and South<br>
Carolina were not yet quite ready for so radical a step. Postponement<br>
was therefore had till July 1st, a committee meantime being appointed to<br>
draft a declaration.<br>
<br>
On July 2d, after further long debate, participated in by John Adams,<br>
Dickinson, Wilson, and many other of the ablest men in Congress, not<br>
all, even now, favorable to the measure, the famous Declaration of<br>
Independence was adopted by vote of all the colonies but New York, whose<br>
representatives abstained from voting for lack of sufficiently definite<br>
instructions. We celebrate July 4th because on that day the document was<br>
authenticated by the signatures of the President and Secretary of<br>
Congress, and published, Not until August 2d had all the representatives<br>
affixed their names. Ellery stood at the secretary's side as the various<br>
delegates signed, and declares that he saw only dauntless resolution in<br>
every eye. "Now we must hang together," said Franklin, "or we shall hang<br>
separately."<br>
<br>
The honor of writing the Declaration belongs to Thomas Jefferson, of<br>
Virginia, who was to play so prominent a part in the early political<br>
history of the United States. At this time he was thirty-three years<br>
old. He was by profession a lawyer, of elegant tastes, well read in<br>
literature, deeply versed in political history and philosophy. He was<br>
chosen to draft the instrument chiefly because of the great ability of<br>
other state papers from his pen. It is said that he consulted no books<br>
during the composition, but wrote from the overflowing fulness of his<br>
mind.<br>
<br>
It is an interesting inquiry how far the language of the document was<br>
determined by utterances of a like kind already put forth by towns and<br>
counties. There had been many of these, and much discussion has occurred<br>
upon the question which of them was first. Perhaps the honor belongs to<br>
the town of Sheffield, Mass., which so early as January 12, 1773,<br>
proclaimed the grievances and the rights of the colonies, among these<br>
the right of self-government. Mendon, in the same State, in the same<br>
year passed resolutions containing three fundamental propositions of the<br>
great Declaration itself: that all men have an equal right to life and<br>
liberty, that this right is inalienable, and that government must<br>
originate in the free consent of the people. It is worthy of note that<br>
the only important change made by Congress in what Jefferson had<br>
prepared was the striking out, in deference to South Carolina and<br>
Georgia, of a clause reflecting on slavery.<br>
<br>
Copies of the immortal paper were carried post-haste up and down the<br>
land, and Congress's bold deed was everywhere hailed with enthusiastic<br>
demonstrations of joy. The stand for independence wrought powerfully for<br>
good, both at home and abroad. At home it assisted vacillating minds to<br>
a decision, as well as bound all the colonies more firmly together by<br>
committing them irreconcilably to an aggressive policy. Abroad it tended<br>
to lift the colonies out of the position of rebels and to gain them<br>
recognition among the nations of the earth.<br>
<br>
Let us now inquire into the political character of these bodies of<br>
people which this Declaration by their delegates had erected into "free<br>
and independent States."<br>
<br>
Five colonies had adopted constitutions, revolutionary of course, before<br>
the decisive manifesto. There was urgent need for such action. The few<br>
remaining fragments of royal governments were powerless and decadent.<br>
Anarchy was threatening everywhere. Some of the royal governors had<br>
fled. In South Carolina the judges refused to act. In other places, as<br>
western Massachusetts, they had been forcibly prevented from acting. In<br>
most of the colonies only small parts of the old assemblies could be<br>
gotten together.<br>
<br>
New Hampshire led off with a new constitution in January, 1776. South<br>
Carolina followed in March. By the close of the year nearly all the<br>
colonies had established governments of their own. New York and Georgia<br>
did not formally adopt new constitutions until the next year. In<br>
Massachusetts a popular assembly assumed legislative and executive<br>
powers from July, 1775, till 1780, when a new constitution went into<br>
force. Connecticut and Rhode Island, as we have seen already, continued<br>
to use their royal charters--the former till 1818, the latter till 1842.<br>
<br>
Nowhere was the general framework of government greatly changed by<br>
independence. The governors were of course now elected by the people,<br>
and they suffered some diminution of power. Legislatures were composed<br>
of two houses, both elective, no hereditary legislators being<br>
recognized. All the States still had Sunday laws; most of them had<br>
religious tests. In South Carolina only members of a church could vote.<br>
In New Jersey an office-holder must profess belief in the faith of some<br>
Protestant sect. Pennsylvania required members of the legislature to<br>
avow faith in God, a future state, and the inspiration of the<br>
Scriptures. The new Massachusetts constitution provided that laws<br>
against plays, extravagance in dress, diet, etc., should be passed.<br>
Property qualifications continued to limit suffrage. Virginia and<br>
Georgia changed their land laws, abolishing entails and primogeniture.<br>
<br>
The sole momentous novelty was that everyone of the new constitutions<br>
proceeded upon the theory of popular sovereignty. The new governments<br>
derived their authority solely and directly from the people. And this<br>
authority, too, was not surrendered to the government, but simply--and<br>
this only in part--intrusted to it as the temporary agent of the<br>
sovereign people, who remained throughout the exclusive source of<br>
political power.<br>
<br>
The new instruments of government were necessarily faulty and imperfect.<br>
All have since been amended, and several entirely remodelled. But they<br>
rescued the colonies from impending anarchy and carried them safely<br>
through the throes of the Revolution.<br>
<br>
<br>

CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
OUTBREAK OF WAR: WASHINGTON'S MOVEMENTS<br>
<br>
[1775]<br>
<br>
By the spring of 1775 Massachusetts was practically in rebellion. Every<br>
village green was a drill-ground, every church a town arsenal. General<br>
Gage occupied Boston with 3,000 British regulars. The flames were<br>
smouldering; at the slightest puff they would flash out into open war.<br>
<br>
On the night of April 18th people along the road from Boston to Concord<br>
were roused from sleep by the cry of flying couriers--"To arms! The<br>
redcoats are coming!" When the British advance reached Lexington at<br>
early dawn, it found sixty or seventy minute-men drawn up on the green.<br>
"Disperse, ye rebels!" shouted the British officer. A volley was fired,<br>
and seven Americans fell dead. The king's troops, with a shout, pushed<br>
on to Concord. Most of the military stores, however, which they had come<br>
to destroy had been removed. A British detachment advanced to Concord<br>
Bridge, and in the skirmish here the Americans returned the British<br>
fire.<br>

Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill.<br>
A Profile View of the Heights of Charlestown.<br>
<br>
The whole country was by this time swarming with minute-men. The crack<br>
of the rifle was heard from behind every wall and fence and tree along<br>
the line of march. The redcoats kept falling one by one at the hands of<br>
an invisible foe. The march became a retreat, the retreat almost a rout.<br>
At sunset the panting troops found shelter in Boston. Out of 1,800<br>
nearly 300 were killed, wounded, or missing. The American loss was about<br>
ninety. The war of the rebellion had begun.<br>
<br>
All that day and the next night the tramp of minute-men marching to<br>
Boston was heard throughout New England, and by April 20th Gage was<br>
cooped up in the city by an American army. May 25th, he received large<br>
re-enforcements from England.<br>
<br>
On the night of June 16th a thousand men armed with pick and spade stole<br>
out of the American camp. At dawn the startled British found that a<br>
redoubt had sprung up in the night on Breed's Hill (henceforward Bunker<br>
Hill) in Charlestown. Boston was endangered, and the rebels must be<br>
dislodged. About half-past two 2,500 British regulars marched silently<br>
and in perfect order up the hill, expecting to drive out the "rustics"<br>
at the first charge. Colonel Prescott, the commanding American officer,<br>
waited till the regulars were within ten rods. "Fire!" A sheet of flame<br>
burst from the redoubt. The front ranks of the British melted away, and<br>
His Majesty's invincibles retreated in confusion to the foot of the<br>
hill. Again they advance. Again that terrible fire. Again they waver and<br>
fall back. Once more the plucky fellows form for the charge, this time<br>
with bayonets alone. When they are within twenty yards, the muskets<br>
behind the earthworks send forth one deadly discharge, and then are<br>
silent. The ammunition is exhausted. The British swarm into the redoubt.<br>
The Continentals reluctantly retire, Prescott among the last, his coat<br>
rent by bayonets. Joseph Warren, of Boston, the idol of Massachusetts,<br>
was shot while leaving the redoubt. The British killed and wounded<br>
amounted to 1,054--157 of them being officers; the American loss was<br>
nearly 500. The battle put an end to further offensive movements by<br>
Gage. It was a virtual victory for the untrained farmer troops, and all<br>
America took courage.<br>

<br>
<br>
Two days before, Congress had chosen George Washington<br>
commander-in-chief, and on July 2d he arrived at Cambridge. Washington<br>
was forty-three years old. Over six feet in height, and<br>
well-proportioned, he combined great dignity with ease. His early life<br>
as surveyor in a wild country had developed in him marvellous powers of<br>
endurance. His experience in the French and Indian War had given him<br>
considerable military knowledge. But his best title to the high honor<br>
now thrust upon him lay in his wonderful self-control, sound judgment,<br>
lofty patriotism, and sublime courage, which were to carry him, calm and<br>
unflinching, through perplexities and discouragements that would have<br>
overwhelmed a smaller or a meaner man.<br>
<br>
Washington fought England with his hands tied. The Continental<br>
government was the worst possible for carrying on war. There was no<br>
executive. The action of legislative committees was slow and<br>
vacillating, and at best Congress could not enforce obedience on the<br>
part of a colony. Congress, too, afraid of a standing army, would<br>
authorize only short enlistments, so that Washington had frequently to<br>
discharge one army and form another in the face of the enemy. His troops<br>
were ill-disciplined, and scantily supplied with clothing, tents,<br>
weapons, and ammunition. Skilled officers were few, and these rarely<br>
free from local and personal jealousies, impairing their efficiency.<br>
<br>
[1776]<br>
<br>
Washington found that the army around Boston consisted of about 14,500<br>
men fit for duty. He estimated the British forces at 11,000. All the<br>
fall and winter he was obliged to lie inactive for want of powder.<br>
Meantime he distressed the British as much as possible by a close siege.<br>
In the spring, having got more powder, he fortified Dorchester Heights.<br>
The city was now untenable, and on March 17, 1776, all the British<br>
troops, under command of Howe who had succeeded Gage, sailed out of<br>
Boston harbor, never again to set foot on Massachusetts soil.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
June 28th, a British fleet of ten vessels opened fire on Fort Moultrie,<br>
in Charleston harbor, S. C. The fort, commanded by Colonel Moultrie,<br>
returned the fire with remarkable accuracy, and after an engagement of<br>
twelve hours the fleet withdrew, badly crippled. This victory gave<br>
security to South Carolina and Georgia for three years.<br>
<br>
The discomfited fleet sailed for New York, where the British forces were<br>
concentrating. The plan was to seize the Middle States, and thus keep<br>
North and South from helping one another. August 1st, 2,500 English<br>
troops and 8,000 Hessians arrived. The effective British force was now<br>
about 25,000. Washington was holding New York City with about 10,000 men<br>
fit for duty.<br>
<br>
Driven from Long Island by the battle of August 27th, and forced to<br>
abandon New York September 15th, Washington retreated up the Hudson, and<br>
took up a strong position at White Plains. Here the British, attacking,<br>
were defeated in a well-fought engagement; but as they were strongly<br>
re-enforced on October 30th, Washington fell back to Newcastle. Early in<br>
November, guessing that they intended to invade New Jersey and advance<br>
on Philadelphia, he threw his main force across the Hudson.<br>
<br>

General Howe.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fortunes of the American army were now at the lowest ebb, so that<br>
had Howe been an efficient general it must have been either captured or<br>
entirely destroyed. Through the treason of Adjutant Demont, who had<br>
deserted to Lord Percy with complete information of their weakness,<br>
Forts Washington and Lee were captured, November 16th and 20th, with the<br>
loss of 150 killed and wounded, and 2,634 prisoners, besides valuable<br>
stores, small arms, and forty-three pieces of artillery. Manhattan<br>
Island was lost. General Charles Lee, with a considerable portion of the<br>
army, persistently refused to cross the Hudson. Washington, with the<br>
troops remaining, was forced to retreat slowly across New Jersey, the<br>
British army, under Cornwallis, at his very heels, often within<br>
cannon-shot. The New Jersey people were lukewarm, and many accepted<br>
Cornwallis's offers of amnesty. Congress, fearing that Philadelphia<br>
would be taken, adjourned to Baltimore. December 8th, Washington crossed<br>
the Delaware with less than 3,000 men. The British encamped on the<br>
opposite bank of the river. The American army was safe for the present,<br>
having secured all the boats and burned all the bridges within seventy<br>
miles.<br>

<br>
<br>
Washington was soon re-enforced, and now had between five and six<br>
thousand troops. He determined to strike a bold blow that would<br>
electrify the drooping spirits of the army and the country. At Trenton<br>
lay a body of 1,200 Hessians. Christmas night Washington crossed the<br>
Delaware with 2,400 picked men. The current was swift, and the river<br>
full of floating ice; but the boats were handled by Massachusetts<br>
fishermen, and the passage was safely made. Then began the nine-mile<br>
march to Trenton, in a blinding storm of sleet and hail. The soldiers,<br>
many of whom were almost barefoot, stumbled on over the slippery road,<br>
shielding their muskets from the storm as best they could. Trenton was<br>
reached at eight o'clock on the morning of the 26th. An attack was made<br>
by two columns simultaneously. The surprise was complete, and after a<br>
half hour's struggle the Hessians surrendered. Nearly 1,000 prisoners<br>
were taken, besides 1,200 small arms and six guns. Washington safely<br>
retreated across the Delaware.<br>
<br>
[1777]<br>
<br>
Cornwallis, with 7,000 men, hurried from Princeton to attack the<br>
American army. But Washington, on the night of January 2, 1777, leaving<br>
his camp-fires burning, slipped around the British army, routed the<br>
regiments left at Princeton, and pushing on northward went into winter<br>
quarters at Morristown.<br>
<br>
The next campaign opened late. It was the last of August when Howe, with<br>
17,000 men, sailed from New York into Chesapeake Bay, and advanced<br>
toward Philadelphia. Washington flung himself in his path at Brandywine,<br>
September 11th, but was beaten back with heavy loss. September 26th the<br>
British army marched into Philadelphia, whence Congress had fled.<br>
October 4th, Washington attacked the British camp at Germantown. Victory<br>
was almost his when two of the attacking parties, mistaking each other,<br>
in the fog, for British, threw the movement into confusion, and<br>
Washington had to fall back, with a loss of 1,000 men.<br>
<br>
In December the American commander led his ragged army into winter<br>
quarters at Valley Forge, twenty-one miles from Philadelphia. It was a<br>
period of deep gloom. The war had been waged now for more than two<br>
years, and less than nothing seemed to have been accomplished. Distrust<br>
of Washington's ability sprang up in some minds. "Heaven grant us one<br>
great soul!" exclaimed John Adams after Brandywine. Certain officers,<br>
envious of Washington, began to intrigue for his place.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the army was shivering in its log huts at Valley Forge. Nearly<br>
three thousand were barefoot. Many had to sit by the fires all night to<br>
keep from freezing. One day there was a dinner of officers to which none<br>
were admitted who had whole trousers. For days together there was no<br>
bread in camp. The death-rate increased thirty-three per cent from week<br>
to week.<br>
<br>
Just now, however, amid this terrible Winter at Valley Forge, Baron<br>
Steuben, a&nbsp; trained German soldier, who had been a pupil of
Frederick<br>
the Great, joined our army. Washington made him inspector-general, and<br>
his rigorous daily drill vastly improved the discipline and the spirits<br>
of the American troops. When they left camp in the spring, spite of the<br>
hardships past, they formed a military force on which Washington could<br>
reckon with certainty for efficient work.<br>

The British, after a gay winter in Philadelphia, startled by the news<br>
that a French fleet was on its way to America, marched for New York,<br>
June 18,1778. The American army overtook them at Monmouth on the 28th;<br>
General Charles Lee--a traitor as we now know, and as Washington then<br>
suspected, forced into high place by influence in Congress--General Lee<br>
led the party intended to attack, but he delayed so long that the<br>
British attacked him instead.<br>
<br>
The Americans were retreating through a narrow defile when Washington<br>
came upon the field, and his Herculean efforts, brilliantly seconded by<br>
Wayne, stayed the rout. A stout stand was made, and the British were<br>
held at bay till evening, when they retired and continued their march to<br>
New York. Washington followed and took up his station at White Plains.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
THE NORTHERN CAMPAIGN<br>
<br>
[1775]<br>
<br>
At the outbreak of hostilities the thoughts of the colonists naturally<br>
turned to the Canadian border, the old battleground of the French and<br>
Indian War. Then and now a hostility was felt for Canada which had not<br>
slumbered since the burning of Schenectady in 1690.<br>
<br>
May 10, 1775, Ethan Allen, at the head of a party of "Green Mountain<br>
Boys," surprised Fort Ticonderoga. Crown Point was taken two days later.<br>
Two hundred and twenty cannon, besides other much-needed military<br>
stores, fell into the hands of the Americans. Some of these heavy guns,<br>
hauled over the Green Mountains on oxsleds the next winter, were planted<br>
by Washington on Dorchester Heights.<br>
<br>
In November, 1775, St. Johns and Montreal were captured by a small force<br>
under General Montgomery. The Americans now seemed in a fair way to get<br>
control of all Canada, which contained only 700 regular troops. It was<br>
even hoped that Canada would make common cause with the colonies. Late<br>
in the fall Benedict Arnold led 1,000 men up the Kennebec River and<br>
through the wilderness--a terrible journey--to Quebec. Here he was<br>
joined by Montgomery. On the night of December 30th, which was dark and<br>
stormy, Montgomery and Arnold led their joint forces, numbering some<br>
3,000, against the city. Arnold was to attack the lower town, while<br>
Montgomery sought to gain the citadel. Montgomery had hardly passed the<br>
first line of barricades when he was shot dead, and his troops retreated<br>
in confusion. Arnold, too, was early wounded. Morgan, with 500 of his<br>
famous riflemen, forced an entrance into the lower town. But they were<br>
not re-enforced, and after a desperate street fight were taken<br>
prisoners.<br>
<br>
[1776]<br>
<br>
A dreary and useless blockade was maintained for several months; until<br>
in May the garrison sallied forth and routed the besiegers. The British<br>
were successful in several small engagements during the summer of 1776;<br>
and the Americans finally had to fall back to Crown Point and<br>
Ticonderoga.<br>

In June of the next year a splendid expedition set sail from St. Johns<br>
and swept proudly up Lake Champlain. Eight thousand British and Hessian<br>
troops, under strict discipline and ably officered, forty cannon of the<br>
best make, a horde of merciless Indians--with these forces General<br>
Burgoyne, the commander of the expedition, expected to make an easy<br>
conquest of upper New York, form a junction with Clinton at Albany, and,<br>
by thus isolating New England from the Middle and Southern States, break<br>
the back of the rebellion.<br>
<br>
Ticonderoga was the first point of attack. Sugar Loaf Mountain, which<br>
rose six hundred feet above the lake, had been neglected as too<br>
difficult of access. Burgoyne's skilful engineers easily fortified this<br>
on the night of July 4th, and Fort Ticonderoga became untenable. General<br>
St. Clair, with his garrison of 3,000, at once evacuated it, and fled<br>
south under cover of the night. He was pursued, and his rear guard of<br>
1,200 men was shattered. The rest of his force reached Fort Edward.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The loss of Ticonderoga spread alarm throughout the North. General<br>
Schuyler, the head of the Northern department, appealed to Washington<br>
for re-enforcements, and fell back from Fort Edward to the junction of<br>
the Mohawk and Hudson.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Burgoyne was making a toilsome march toward Fort Edward.<br>
Schuyler had destroyed the bridges and obstructed the roads, so that the<br>
invading army was twenty-four days in going twenty-six miles. Up to this<br>
point Burgoyne's advance had been little less than a triumphal march;<br>
difficulties now began to surround him like a net.<br>
<br>
Burgoyne had arranged for a branch expedition of 700 troops and 1,000<br>
Indians under St. Leger, to sail up Lake Ontario, sweep across western<br>
New York, and join the main body at Albany. August 3d, this expedition<br>
reached Fort Schuyler, and besieged it. A party of 800 militia, led by<br>
General Herkimer, a veteran German soldier, while marching to relieve<br>
the fort, was surprised by an Indian ambush. The bloody battle of<br>
Oriskany followed. St. Leger's further advance was checked, and soon<br>
after, alarmed by exaggerated reports of a second relief expedition<br>
under Arnold, he hurried back to Canada.<br>
<br>
At Bennington, twenty-five miles east of Burgoyne's line of march, the<br>
Americans had a depot of stores and horses. Burgoyne, who was running<br>
short of provisions, sent a body of 500 troops, under Baume, to capture<br>
these stores, and overawe the inhabitants by a raid through the<br>
Connecticut valley. About 2,000 militia hastened to the defence of<br>
Bennington. General Stark, who had fought gallantly at Bunker Hill and<br>
Trenton, took command. August 16th, Baume was attacked on three sides at<br>
once, Stark himself leading the charge against the enemy's front. Again<br>
and again his men dashed up the hill where the British lay behind<br>
breastworks. After a fight of two hours Baume surrendered, overpowered<br>
by superior numbers. Re-enforcements which came up a little later were<br>
driven back with considerable loss. The Americans took 700 prisoners and<br>
1,000 stands of arms.<br>

<br>
<br>
Burgoyne's situation was becoming dangerous. The failure of St. Leger<br>
and the heavy loss at Bennington seriously disarranged his plans. The<br>
troops detached to defend the posts in his rear had reduced his force to<br>
about 6,000. He was greatly hampered by lack of provisions. Meanwhile<br>
the American army had increased to 9,000. Schuyler had been supplanted<br>
by Gates, who on September 12th advanced to a strong position on Bemis<br>
Heights in the town of Stillwater. The right wing of the army rested on<br>
the Hudson, the left on ridges and wood. In front was a ravine. On the<br>
19th Burgoyne advanced to the attack in three columns. That led by<br>
General Fraser, which tried to turn the American left, was the first to<br>
engage. Arnold's wing, including Morgan's riflemen, met Fraser's<br>
skirmishers a mile from the American lines. They were soon forced to<br>
fall back; Burgoyne's central column came up, and the fight became<br>
general. The battleground was covered by thick woods, with occasional<br>
clearings, and the troops fought at close range. Four hours the battle<br>
raged hotly. The British artillery was taken and retaken again and<br>
again. Thirty-six of the forty-eight British gunners were either killed<br>
or wounded. At sunset the Americans withdrew to their fortified lines,<br>
leaving Burgoyne in possession of the field. It was a drawn battle, but<br>
virtually a victory for the Americans. The British lost about 600, the<br>
Americans half as many.<br>
<br>

General John Stark.<br>
<br>
<br>
Burgoyne's situation was now critical in the extreme. In the heart of<br>
the enemy's country, his forces melting away while his opponents were<br>
increasing, nearly out of provisions and his connections with his base<br>
of supplies threatened by a party assailing Ticonderoga, Burgoyne's only<br>
hope was that Clinton would force a passage up the Hudson. But the<br>
latter, after capturing Forts Clinton and Montgomery early in October,<br>
fell back to the lower Hudson and left Burgoyne to his fate.<br>
<br>
October 7th, Burgoyne advanced a picked body of 1,500 men to reconnoitre<br>
the American lines. Morgan's riflemen were sent out to "begin the game."<br>
The fighting soon became even hotter than in the previous battle. In an<br>
hour the whole British line was retreating toward the camp. At this<br>
point Arnold, whom, because of his preference for Schuyler, Gates had<br>
deprived of his command, filled with the fury of battle, dashed upon the<br>
field and assumed his old command. The soldiers greeted him with cheers,<br>
and he led them on in one impetuous charge after another. The enemy<br>
everywhere gave way in confusion, and at dusk the Germans were even<br>
driven from their entrenched camp. The British loss was fully 600.<br>
<br>

General Horatio Gates.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next day Burgoyne retreated to Saratoga, followed by Gates. The fine<br>
army, which had set out with such high hopes only four months before,<br>
was now almost a wreck. Eight hundred were in the hospital. On the 12th<br>
the army had but five days' rations. Burgoyne could neither advance nor<br>
retreat, and on the 17th he surrendered. The army were allowed free<br>
passage to England on condition that they would not re-engage in the<br>
war. The Americans got 35 superb cannon and 4,000 muskets. The Sunday<br>
after the surrender, Timothy Dwight, afterward President of Yale<br>
College, preached to Gates's soldiers from Joel ii. 20, "I will remove<br>
far off from you the northern army."<br>
<br>
Gates deserved little credit for the defeat of Burgoyne. Put forward by<br>
New England influence against Schuyler, the favorite of New York, he but<br>
reaped the results of the labors of Herkimer at Oriskany, of Stark at<br>
Bennington, and of Schuyler in obstructing Burgoyne's advance and in<br>
raising a sufficient army. Even in the two battles of Stillwater Gates<br>
did next to nothing, not even appearing on the field. Arnold and Morgan<br>
were the soul of the army on both days. Arnold's gallant conduct was at<br>
once rewarded by a major-generalship. Schuyler, underrated and even<br>
maligned in his day, had to wait for the approval of posterity, which he<br>
has now fully obtained.<br>
<br>
The surrender of Burgoyne was the most important event of the war up to<br>
that time. It was of immense service at home, raising the country out of<br>
the despondency which followed upon Brandywine and Germantown. Abroad it<br>
disheartened England, and decided France to acknowledge the independence<br>
of America and to send military aid. From the end of this year, 1777,<br>
victory over England was a practical certainty.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
THE SOUTHERN CAMPAIGNS<br>
<br>
[1778]<br>
<br>
After the summer of 1778 little of military importance occurred at the<br>
North. July and November of that year were marked by bloody Indian<br>
massacres at Wyoming, Pa., and Cherry Valley, N. Y., the worst in all<br>
that border warfare which was incessant from the beginning to the end of<br>
the Revolution. In August an unsuccessful attempt to regain Newport was<br>
made by General Sullivan, co-operating with a French fleet under<br>
D'Estaing. In the spring and summer of 1779, Clinton, who lay at New<br>
York with a considerable army, closely watched by Washington, sent out<br>
to Connecticut and the coasts of Virginia a number of plundering<br>
expeditions which did much damage. "Mad Anthony Wayne" led a brilliant<br>
attack against Stony Point on the Hudson, captured the British garrison,<br>
and destroyed the fortifications. This year was also marked by a great<br>
naval victory. Paul Jones lashed his vessel, the Bonhomme Richard, to<br>
the British Serapis, off the northeast coast of England, and after a<br>
desperate fight of three hours forced the Serapis to surrender.<br>
<br>
But the brunt of the war now fell on the South, where the British,<br>
unsuccessful in the Northern and Middle States, hoped for an easy<br>
conquest. The capture of Savannah in December, 1778, and of Augusta the<br>
next month, laid Georgia prostrate. The royal government was re-instated<br>
by Prevost, the British general. Our General Lincoln, who had been<br>
placed in command of the Southern army, assisted by D'Estaing with his<br>
fleet, besieged Savannah, but on October 9, 1779, was repulsed with<br>
heavy loss.<br>
<br>
[1780]<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1780 Clinton arrived from New York with a fleet and<br>
troops. Charleston, S. C, was besieged by land and sea. Lincoln was<br>
compelled to surrender with his whole army. Beaufort, Ninety-Six, and<br>
Camden capitulated in rapid succession. Marauding expeditions overran<br>
the State. President Andrew Jackson carried to his grave scars of hurts,<br>
one on his head, another on his hand, given him by Tarleton's men when<br>
he was a boy at Waxhaw. The patriots lay helpless. The loyalists<br>
organized as militia and joined the British. Clinton, elated by success,<br>
hoped to force the entire population into allegiance to the king. The<br>
estates of patriots were sequestered. Any Carolinian found in arms<br>
against the king might be, and multitudes were, hung for treason.<br>
Clinton even issued a proclamation requiring all inhabitants to take<br>
active part on the royalist side. Sumter, Marion, and other leaders,<br>
gathering around them little companies of bold men, carried on a<br>
guerilla warfare which proved very annoying to the British. They would<br>
sally forth from their hiding-places in the swamps, surprise some<br>
British outpost or cut off&nbsp; some detachment, and retreat with their<br>
booty and prisoners before pursuit could be made.<br>

But the British army in South Carolina and Georgia was 7,000 strong.<br>
Help must come from without. And help was coming. Washington detached<br>
from his scanty army 2,000 Maryland troops and the Delaware<br>
regiment--all veterans--and sent them south under De Kalb, a brave<br>
officer of German blood, who had seen long service in France. Virginia,<br>
though herself exposed, nobly contributed arms and men. Gates, the<br>
laurels of Saratoga still fresh upon his brow, was, against Washington's<br>
judgment, appointed by Congress to succeed Lincoln.<br>
<br>
Cornwallis, whom the return of Clinton to New York had left in command,<br>
lay at Camden, S. C. Gates, as if he had but to look the Briton in the<br>
eye to beat him, pompously assumed the offensive. On August 15th he made<br>
a night march to secure a more favorable position near Camden.<br>
Cornwallis happened to have chosen&nbsp; the same night for an attack
upon<br>
Gates. The two armies unexpectedly met in the woods, nine miles from<br>
Camden, early in the morning of the 16th. Gates's force, increased by<br>
North Carolina militia, was between 3,000 and 4,000. Cornwallis had<br>
about 2,000. The American position was strong, a swamp protecting both<br>
flanks, but at the first bayonet charge of the British veterans the raw<br>
militia threw away their guns and "ran like a torrent." The Maryland and<br>
Delaware Continentals stood their ground bravely, but were finally<br>
obliged to retreat. De Kalb fell, with eleven wounds.<br>
<br>

General Sullivan.<br>
<br>
<br>
This heroic foreigner had been sent hither by Choiseul before the<br>
Revolution to report to the French minister on American affairs, and at<br>
the outbreak of war had at great cost cast in his lot with our fathers.<br>
Sent south to aid Lincoln, he arrived only in time to be utilized by<br>
Gates. De Kalb was the hero of Camden. Wounded and his horse shot from<br>
under him, on foot he led his stanch division in a charge which drove<br>
Rawdon's men and took fifty prisoners. Believing his side victorious he<br>
would not yield, though literally ridden down by Cornwallis' dragoons,<br>
till his wounds exhausted him. Two-fifths of his noble division fell<br>
with him.<br>
<br>
The whole army was pursued for miles&nbsp; and completely scattered.
Arms,<br>
knapsacks, broken wagons, dead horses strewed the line of retreat. The<br>
Americans lost 900 killed and as many more prisoners. The British loss<br>
was less than 500. Gates, who had been literally borne off the field by<br>
the panic-stricken militia, rode in all haste two hundred miles north to<br>
Hillsborough, N. C, where he tried to organize a new army.<br>
<br>

General Lincoln.<br>
<br>
<br>
The gloom created at the North by this defeat was deepened by the<br>
startling news that Benedict Arnold, the hero of Saratoga, had turned<br>
traitor. Smarting under a reprimand from Washington for misconduct,<br>
Arnold agreed with Clinton to surrender West Point. The plot was<br>
discovered by the capture of Clinton's agent, Major Andre, who was hung<br>
as a spy. Arnold escaped to the British lines.<br>
<br>
There was now no organized American force in the Carolinas, and<br>
Cornwallis began a triumphant march northward. The brave mountaineers of<br>
North Carolina and Virginia rose in arms. October 7th, 1,000 riflemen<br>
fell upon a detachment of 1,100 British, strongly posted on King's<br>
Mountain, N. C, and after a sharp struggle killed and wounded about 400,<br>
and took the rest prisoners. In this battle fell one of the Tory<br>
ancestors of the since distinguished American De Peyster family.<br>
<br>
The King's Mountain victory filled the patriots with new hope and zeal,<br>
and kept the loyalists from rising to support the British. Cornwallis<br>
marched south again.<br>

Gates was now removed and General Nathaniel Greene placed in charge of<br>
the Southern department. Greene was one of the most splendid figures in<br>
the Revolution. Son of a Rhode Island Quaker, bred a blacksmith,<br>
ill-educated save-by private study, which in mathematics, history, and<br>
law he had carried far, he was in 1770 elected to the legislature of his<br>
colony. Zeal to fight England for colonial liberty lost him his place in<br>
the Friends' Society. Heading Rhode Island's contingent to join<br>
Washington before Boston at the first shock of Revolutionary arms, he<br>
was soon made brigadier, the initial step in his rapid promotion.<br>
Showing himself an accomplished fighter at Trenton, Princeton,<br>
Germantown, Monmouth, and the battle of Rhode Island, and a first-rate<br>
organizer as quartermaster-general of the army, he had long been<br>
Washington's right-hand man; and his superior now sent him south with<br>
high hopes and ringing words of recommendation to the army and people<br>
there.<br>

<br>
Greene's plan of campaign was the reverse of Gates's. He meant to harass<br>
and hinder the enemy at every step, avoiding pitched battles. January<br>
17, 1781, a portion of his army, about 1,000 strong, under the famous<br>
General Daniel Morgan, of Virginia, another hero of Saratoga, was<br>
attacked at Cowpens, S. C., by an equal number of British under the<br>
dashing Tarleton. The British, riddled by a terrible cross-fire from<br>
Morgan's unerring riflemen, followed up by a bayonet charge, fled, and<br>
were for twenty-four miles pursued by cavalry. The American loss was<br>
trifling. Tarleton lost 300 in killed and wounded, and 500 prisoners,<br>
besides 100 horses, 35 wagons, and 800 muskets.<br>
<br>

Benedict Arnold.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cornwallis began a second march northward. Greene's force was too weak<br>
to risk a battle. His soldiers were poorly clad, and most of them were<br>
without tents or shoes. He therefore skillfully retreated across North<br>
Carolina, chased by Cornwallis. Twice the rivers, rising suddenly after<br>
Greene had crossed, checked his pursuers. But on March 15th, re-enforced<br>
to about 4,000, the Quaker general offered battle to Cornwallis at<br>
Guilford Court-House, N. C. He drew up his forces on a wooded hill in<br>
three lines one behind the other. The first line, consisting of raw<br>
North Carolina militia, fled before the British bayonet charge, hardly<br>
firing a shot. The Virginia brigade constituting the second line made a<br>
brave resistance, but was soon driven back. On swept the British<br>
columns, flushed with victory, against the third line. Here Greek met<br>
Greek. The Continentals stood their ground like the veterans they were.<br>
After a long and bloody fight the British were driven back. The<br>
fugitives, however, presently rallied under cover of theartillery, when<br>
Greene, fearing to risk more, withdrew from the field. The British lost<br>
500; the Americans, 400, besides a large part of the militia, who<br>
dispersed to their homes. Cornwallis, with his "victorious but ruined<br>
army," retreated to the southern part of the State. The last of April he<br>
forsook Carolina, and marched into Virginia with 1,400 men.<br>
<br>

Arnold's Escape.<br>
<br>
<br>
Greene, his force reduced to 1,800, carried the war into South Carolina.<br>
Defeated at Hobkirk's Hill, near Camden, and compelled by the approach<br>
of General Rawdon to raise the siege of Ninety-Six, he retreated north.<br>
Meantime Marion and Lee had brought about the evacuation of Camden and<br>
Augusta. Rawdon soon evacuated Ninety-Six, and moved toward the coast,<br>
followed by Greene.<br>
<br>
A ceaseless guerilla warfare was kept up, attended with many<br>
barbarities. Slave-stealing was a favorite pursuit on both sides. It is<br>
noteworthy that the followers of Sumter, fighting in the cause of<br>
freedom, were paid largely in slaves. The whole campaign was marked by<br>
severities unknown at the North. The British shot as deserters all who,<br>
having once accepted royal protection, were taken in arms against the<br>
king. In a few cases Americans dealt similarly with Americans fighting<br>
for the British, but in general their procedure was infinitely the more<br>
humane.<br>
<br>

General Nathaniel Greene.<br>
<br>
<br>
The battle of Eutaw Springs practically ended the war in the South. The<br>
British were victorious, but all the advantages of the battle accrued to<br>
the Americans. The British loss was nearly 1,000; the American, 600. In<br>
ten months Greene had driven the British from all Georgia and the<br>
Carolinas except Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah.<br>
<br>
Destiny decreed that Washington should strike the last blow for his<br>
country's freedom on the soil of his own State. Cornwallis found himself<br>
in Virginia, the last of May, at the head of 7,000 troops. He ravaged<br>
the State, destroying $10,000,000 worth of property. Lafayette, pitted<br>
against him with 3,000 men, could do little. In August Cornwallis<br>
withdrew into Yorktown, and began fortifications. Lafayette's quick eye<br>
saw that the British general had caged himself. Posting his army so as<br>
to prevent Cornwallis's escape, he advised Washington to hasten with his<br>
army to Virginia. Meanwhile a French fleet blocked up the mouth of<br>
Chesapeake Bay and of James River and York River, cutting off<br>
Cornwallis's escape by water. The last of September Washington's army,<br>
accompanied by the French troops under Rochambeau, appeared before<br>
Yorktown. Clinton, deceived by Washington into the belief that New York<br>
was to be attacked, was still holding that city with 18,000 men. The<br>
American army, 16,000 strong--7,000 French--began a regular siege.<br>
Cornwallis was doomed.<br>

Two advanced redoubts of the British works were soon carried by a<br>
brilliant assault in which the French and the American troops won equal<br>
honors. On the 19th Cornwallis surrendered. The captive army, numbering<br>
7,247, marched with cased colors between two long lines of American and<br>
French troops, and laid down their arms.<br>
<br>
The news of Cornwallis's surrender flew like wild-fire over the country.<br>
Everywhere the victory was hailed as virtually ending the war. Bonfires<br>
and booming cannon told of the joy of the people. Congress assembled,<br>
and marching to church in a body, not as a mere form, we may well<br>
believe, gave thanks to the God of battles, so propitious at last.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
PEACE<br>
<br>
[1782]<br>
<br>
The peace party and spirit in England increased month by month.<br>
Burgoyne's surrender had dissipated the hope of speedily suppressing the<br>
rebellion. And as the war dragged on and Englishmen by bitter experience<br>
came to realize the bravery, endurance, and national feeling of the<br>
Americans, the conviction spread that three millions of such people,<br>
separated from the mother-country by three thousand miles of boisterous<br>
ocean, could never be conquered by force. Discouragement arose, too,<br>
from the ill conduct of the war. There was no broad plan or consistency<br>
in management. Generals did not agree or co-operate, and were changed<br>
too often. Clinton and Cornwallis hated each other. Burgoyne superseded<br>
Carleton, a better man. But for Lord Germain's "criminal negligence" in<br>
waiting to go upon a visit before sending the proper orders, Clinton<br>
might have met and saved Burgoyne.<br>
<br>
There were enormous and needless expenses. By 1779 England's national<br>
debt had increased 63,000,000 pounds; by 1782 it had doubled. Rents were<br>
declining. The price of land had fallen one-third. Hence the war became<br>
unpopular with the landed aristocracy. British manufacturers suffered by<br>
the narrowing of their foreign markets. American privateers, prowling in<br>
all seas, had captured hundreds of British merchant-men. English<br>
sentiment, too, revolted at certain features of the war. Ravaging and<br>
the use of mercenaries and Indians were felt to be barbarous. Time made<br>
clearer the initial error of the government in invoking war over the<br>
doubtful right of taxing America. An increasing number of lawyers took<br>
the American view. Practical men figured out that each year of<br>
hostilities cost more than the proposed tax would have yielded in a<br>
century.<br>
<br>
In February, 1778, Parliament almost unanimously adopted proposals to<br>
restore the state of things which existed in America before the war, at<br>
the same time declaring its intention not to exercise its right of<br>
taxing the colonies. Washington spoke for America when he said, "Nothing<br>
but independence will now do." The proposals were rejected by Congress<br>
and by the States separately.<br>
<br>
England's difficulties were greatly increased by the help extended to<br>
America from abroad. France, eager for revenge on England, early in the<br>
war lent secret aid by money and military supplies. Later, emboldened by<br>
the defeat of Burgoyne, the French Government recognized the United<br>
States as an independent nation. By a treaty, offensive and defensive,<br>
the two nations bound themselves to fight together for that<br>
independence, neither to conclude a separate peace.<br>
<br>
The benefit from this treaty was moral and financial rather than<br>
martial. At Yorktown, to be sure, the French forces rendered invaluable<br>
aid. Without De Grasse's French fleet at the mouths of the York and<br>
James rivers, the British might have relieved Cornwallis by sea. But<br>
Congress needed money more than foreign soldiers, and without France's<br>
liberal loans it is difficult to see how the government could have<br>
struggled through.<br>
<br>
Spain, too, joined the alliance of France and the United States and<br>
declared war against England, though from no love for the young<br>
republic. This action hastened the growth of public opinion in England<br>
against the continuance of the American war. In the House of Commons,<br>
Lord Cavendish made a motion for ordering home the troops. Lord North,<br>
prime minister, threw out hints that it was useless to continue the war.<br>
But George III., summoning his ministers, declared his unchanging<br>
resolution never to yield to the rebels, and continued prodding the<br>
wavering North to stumble on in his stupid course.<br>
<br>
It was struggling against fate. The next year saw Holland at war with<br>
England, while Catherine, Empress of Russia, was actively organizing the<br>
Armed Neutrality, by which all the other states of Europe leagued<br>
together to resist England's practice of stopping vessels on the high<br>
seas and searching them for contraband goods.<br>
<br>

Lord Cornwallis.<br>
<br>
<br>
England was now involved in four wars, without money to carry them on.<br>
North's majorities in Parliament grew steadily smaller. No doubt much of<br>
the opposition was simply factious and partisan, but it had, after all,<br>
solid basis in principle. England was fighting her own<br>
policy--economically, for she was destined to free trade, and<br>
politically, inasmuch as the freedom which our fathers sought was<br>
nothing but English freedom.<br>
<br>
The surrender of Cornwallis tipped the scale. Lord North, when he heard<br>
the news, paced the room in agony, exclaiming again and again, "O God,<br>
it is all over!" The House of Commons, without even a division, resolved<br>
to "consider as enemies to His Majesty and the country" all who should<br>
advise a further prosecution of the war. North resigned, and Shelburne,<br>
Secretary of State in the new ministry, hastened to open peace<br>
negotiations with Franklin at Paris.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 465px; height: 730px;" alt="" src="images/129Pic.jpg"><br>
Benjamin Franklin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benjamin Franklin, now venerable with years, had been doing at the court<br>
of Versailles a work hardly less important than that of Washington on<br>
the battlefields of America. By the simple grace and dignity of his<br>
manners, by his large good sense and freedom of thought, by his fame as<br>
a scientific discoverer, above all by his consummate tact in the<br>
management of men, the whilom printer, king's postmaster-general for<br>
America, discoverer, London colonial agent, delegate in the Continental<br>
Congress, and signer of the Declaration of Independence, had completely<br>
captivated elegant, free-thinking France. Learned and common folk, the<br>
sober and the frivolous alike, swore by Franklin. Snuff-boxes,<br>
furniture, dishes, even stoves, were gotten up a la Franklin. The old<br>
man's portrait was in every house. That the French Government, in spite<br>
of a monarch who was half afraid of the rising nation beyond sea, had<br>
given America her hearty support, was in no small measure due to the<br>
influence of Franklin. And his skill in diplomacy was of the greatest<br>
value in the negotiations now pending.<br>
<br>
These were necessarily long and tedious, but Jay, Franklin's colleague,<br>
made them needlessly so by his finical refusal to treat till England had<br>
acknowledged our independence by a separate act. This, indeed,<br>
jeopardized peace itself, since Shelburne's days of ministerial power<br>
were closing, and his successor was sure to be less our friend. Jay at<br>
last receded, a compromise being arrived at by which the treaty was to<br>
open with a virtual recognition of independence in acknowledging Adams,<br>
Franklin, and Jay as "plenipotentiaries," that is, agents of a sovereign<br>
power. Boundaries, fishery rights, and the treatment of loyalists and<br>
their property were the chief bones of contention.<br>
<br>
As the negotiations wore on it became apparent that Spain and France,<br>
now that their vengeance was sated against England by our independence,<br>
were more unfriendly to our territorial enlargement than England itself.<br>
There still exists a map on which Spain's minister had indicated what he<br>
wished to make our western bound. The line follows nearly the meridian<br>
of Pittsburgh. This attitude of those powers excused our<br>
plenipotentiaries, though bound by our treaty with France not to<br>
conclude peace apart from her, for making the preliminary arrangements<br>
with England privately. At last, on November 30, 1782, Franklin, Jay,<br>
and John Adams set their signatures to preliminary articles, which were<br>
incorporated in a treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United<br>
States, France, and Spain, signed at Paris on September 3, 1783. David<br>
Hartley signed for England. Our Congress ratified on February 14, 1784.<br>
<br>
The treaty recognized the independence of the United States. It<br>
established as boundaries nearly the present Canadian line on the north,<br>
the Mississippi on the west, and Florida, which now returned to Spain<br>
and extended to the Mississippi, on the south. Despite the wishes of<br>
Spain, the free navigation of the Mississippi, from source to mouth, was<br>
guaranteed to the United States and Great Britain. Fishery rights<br>
received special attention. American fishermen were granted the<br>
privilege of fishing, as before the war, on the banks of Newfoundland,<br>
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and in all other places in the sea where<br>
the inhabitants of both countries had been accustomed to fish. Liberty<br>
was also granted to take fish on such parts of the coast of Newfoundland<br>
as British fishermen should use, and on the coasts, bays, and creeks of<br>
all other British dominions in America. American fishermen could dry and<br>
cure fish on the unsettled parts of Nova Scotia, Labrador, and the<br>
Magdalen Islands. America agreed, for the protection of British<br>
creditors, that debts contracted before the war should be held valid,<br>
and should be payable in sterling money. It was also stipulated that<br>
Congress should earnestly recommend to the several States the<br>
restitution of all confiscated property belonging to loyalists.<br>

Facsimile of Signatures to Treaty of Peace<br>
<br>
<br>
[1783]<br>
<br>
Peace came like a heavenly benediction to the country and the army,<br>
exhausted by so long and so fierce a struggle. No general engagement<br>
took place after the siege of Yorktown; but the armies kept close watch<br>
upon each other, and minor skirmishes were frequent. Washington's 10,000<br>
men were encamped near the Hudson, to see that Clinton's forces in New<br>
York did no harm. In the South, Greene's valiant band, aided by Wayne<br>
and his rangers, without regular food or pay, kept the British cooped up<br>
in Charleston and Augusta.<br>
<br>
Congress in due time declared cessation of hostilities, and on April 19,<br>
1783, just eight years from the battle of Lexington, Washington read the<br>
declaration at the headquarters of his army. The British had evacuated<br>
Charleston the previous December. In July, Savannah saw the last of the<br>
redcoats file out, and the British troops were collected at New York. On<br>
November 25th, Sir Guy Carleton, who had superseded Clinton, embarked<br>
with his entire army, besides a throng of refugees, in boats for Long<br>
Island and Staten Island, where they soon took ship for England. "The<br>
imperial standard of Great Britain fell at the fort over which it had<br>
floated for a hundred and twenty years, and in its place the Stars and<br>
Stripes of American Independence flashed in the sun. Fleet and army,<br>
royal flag and scarlet uniform, coronet and ribbon, every sign and<br>
symbol of foreign authority, which from Concord to Saratoga and from<br>
Saratoga to Yorktown had sought to subdue the colonies, vanished from<br>
these shores. Colonial and provincial America had ended, national<br>
America had begun."<br>
<br>
The American troops took possession of New York amid the huzzas of the<br>
people and the roar of cannon. On November 25th, Washington with his<br>
suite, surrounded by grateful and admiring throngs, made a formal entry<br>
into the city whence he had been compelled to flee seven years before.<br>
<br>
The time had now come when the national hero might lay down the great<br>
burden which he had borne with herculean strength and courage through so<br>
many years of distress and gloom. On December 4th he joined his<br>
principal officers at the popular Fraunces's Tavern, near the Battery,<br>
to bid them farewell. Tears filled every eye. Even Washington could not<br>
master his feelings, as one after another the heroes who had been with<br>
him upon the tented field and in so many moments of dreadful strife drew<br>
near to press his hand. They followed him through ranks of parading<br>
infantry to the Whitehall ferry, where he boarded his barge, and waving<br>
his hat in a last, voiceless farewell, crossed to the Jersey shore.<br>
<br>
Arrived at Annapolis after a journey which had been one long ovation,<br>
the saviour of his country appeared before Congress, December 23d, to<br>
resign the commission which he had so grandly fulfilled. His address was<br>
in noble key, but abbreviated by choking emotion. The President of<br>
Congress having replied in fitting words, Washington withdrew, and<br>
continued his journey to the long-missed peace and seclusion of his<br>
Mount Vernon home.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
AMERICAN MANHOOD IN THE REVOLUTION<br>
<br>
[1775-1781]<br>
<br>
It would be foolish to say that the Revolutionary soldiers never<br>
quailed. Militia too often gave way before the steady bayonet charge of<br>
British regulars, at times fleeing panic-stricken. Troops whose term of<br>
service was out would go home at critical moments. Hardships and lack of<br>
pay in a few instances led to mutiny and desertion. But the marvel is<br>
that they fought so bravely, endured so much, and complained so little.<br>
One reason was the patriotism of the people at large behind them.<br>
Soldiers who turned their backs on Boston, leaving Washington in the<br>
lurch, were refused food along the road home. Women placed rifles in the<br>
hands of husbands, sons, or lovers, and said "Go!"<br>
<br>
The rank and file in this war, coming from farm, work-bench,<br>
logging-camp, or fisher's boat, had a superb physical basis for camp and<br>
field life. Used to the rifle from boyhood, they kept their powder dry<br>
and made every one of their scanty bullets tell. The Revolutionary<br>
soldier's splendid courage has glorified a score of battle-fields; while<br>
Valley Forge, with its days of hunger and nights of cold, its sick-beds<br>
on the damp ground, and its bloody footprints in the snow, tell of his<br>
patient endurance.<br>
<br>
At Bunker Hill an undisciplined body of farmers, ill-armed, weary,<br>
hungry and thirsty, calmly awaited the charge of old British<br>
campaigners, and by a fire of dreadful precision drove them back. "They<br>
may talk of their Mindens and their Fontenoys," said the British<br>
general, Howe, "but there was no such fire there." At Charleston, while<br>
the wooden fort shook with the British broadsides, Moultrie and his<br>
South Carolina boys, half naked in the stifling heat, through twelve<br>
long hours smoked their pipes and carefully pointed their guns. At Long<br>
Island, to gain time for the retreat of the rest, five Maryland<br>
companies flew again and again in the face of the pursuing host. At<br>
Monmouth, eight thousand British were in hot pursuit of the retreating<br>
Americans. Square in their front Washington planted two Pennsylvania and<br>
Maryland regiments, saying, "Gentlemen, I depend upon you to hold the<br>
ground until I can form the main army." And hold it they did.<br>
<br>
Heroism grander than that of the battlefield, which can calmly meet an<br>
ignominious death, was not lacking. Captain Nathan Hale, a quiet,<br>
studious spirit, just graduated from Yale College, volunteered to enter<br>
the British lines on Long Island as a spy. He was caught, and soon swung<br>
from an apple tree in Colonel Rutgers's orchard, a corpse. Bible and<br>
religious ministrations denied him, his letters to mother and sister<br>
destroyed, women standing by and sobbing, he met his fate without a<br>
tremor. "I only regret," comes his voice from yon rude scaffold, "that I<br>
have but one life to give for my country." It is a shame that America so<br>
long had no monument to this heroic man. One almost rejoices that the<br>
British captain, Cunningham, author of the cruelty to Hale, himself met<br>
death on the gallows, in London, 1791. How different from Hale's the<br>
treatment bestowed upon Andre, the British spy who fell into our hands.<br>
He was fed from Washington's table, and supported to his execution by<br>
every manifestation of sympathy for his suffering.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 415px; height: 528px;" alt="" src="images/145Pic.jpg"><br>
John Paul Jones.<br>
<br>
<br>
The stanch and useful loyalty of the New England clergy in the<br>
Revolution has been much dwelt upon--none too much, however. With them<br>
should be mentioned the Rev. James Caldwell, Presbyterian pastor at<br>
Elizabeth, N. J., who, when English soldiers raided the town, and its<br>
defenders were short of wadding, tore up his hymn-book for their use,<br>
urging: "Give them Watts, boys, give them Watts."<br>
<br>
No fiercer naval battle was ever fought than when Jones, in the old and<br>
rotten Bon Homme Richard, grappled with the new British frigate Serapis.<br>
Yard-arm to yardarm, port-hole to port-hole, the fight raged for hours.<br>
Three times both vessels were on fire. The Serapis's guns tore a<br>
complete breach in the Richard from main-mast to stern. The Richard was<br>
sinking, but the intrepid Jones fought on, and the Serapis struck.<br>
<br>
<br>

Fight between the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis.<br>
<br>
<br>
As the roll of Revolutionary officers is called, what matchless figures<br>
file past the mind's eye! We see stalwart Ethan Allen entering<br>
Ticonderoga too early in the morning to find its commander in a<br>
presentable condition, and demanding possession "in the name of Almighty<br>
God and the Continental Congress "--destined, himself, in a few months,<br>
to be sailing down the St. Lawrence in irons, bound for long captivity<br>
in England. We behold gallant Prescott leisurely promenading the Bunker<br>
Hill parapet to inspirit his men, shot and shell hurtling thick around.<br>
There is Israel Putnam--"Old Put" the boys dubbed him. He was no<br>
general, but we forgive his costly blunders at Brooklyn Heights and<br>
Peekskill as we think of him leaving plough in furrow at the drum-beat<br>
to arms, and speeding to the deadly front at Boston, or with iron<br>
firmness stemming the retreat from Bunker Hill. Young Richard Montgomery<br>
might have been next to Washington in the war but for Sir Guy Carleton's<br>
deadly grape-shot from the Quebec walls the closing moments of 1775.<br>
Buried at Quebec, his remains were transferred by the State of New York,<br>
July 8, 1818, to their present resting-place in front of St. Paul's, New<br>
York City, the then aged widow tearfully watching the funeral barge as<br>
it floated past Montgomery Place on the Hudson.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 359px; height: 434px;" alt="" src="images/150Pic.jpg"><br>
General Anthony Wayne.<br>
<br>
During a four years' apprenticeship under Washington, General Greene had<br>
caught more of his master's spirit and method than did any other<br>
American leader, and one year's separate command at the South gave him a<br>
martial fame second only to Washington's own. In him the great chief's<br>
word was fulfilled, "I send you a general." A naked, starving army, an<br>
empty military chest, the surrounding country impoverished and full of<br>
loyalists--these were his difficulties. Three States practically cleared<br>
of the royal army in ten months--this was his achievement. He retreated<br>
only to advance, was beaten only to fight again. One hardly knows which<br>
to admire most, his tireless energy and vigilance, his prudence in<br>
retreat, his boldness and vigor in attack, his cheerful courage in<br>
defeat, or his mingled kindness and firmness toward a suffering and<br>
mutinous army.<br>
<br>
John Stark, eccentric but true, famous for cool courage--how stubbornly,<br>
with his New Hampshire boys, he held the rail fence at Bunker Hill, and<br>
covered the retreat when ammunition was gone! But Stark's most brilliant<br>
deed was at Bennington. "There they are, boys--the redcoats, and by<br>
night they're ours, or Molly Stark's a widow." Those "boys," without<br>
bayonets, their artillery shooting stones for balls, were little more<br>
than a mob. But with confidence in him, on they rush, up, over, sweeping<br>
Baume's Hessians from the field like a tornado. The figure of General<br>
Schuyler comes before us--quieter but not less noble, an invalid, set to<br>
hard tasks with little glory. His magnanimous soul forgets self in<br>
country as he cheerfully gives all possible help to Gates, his<br>
supplanter, and puts the torch to his own grain-fields at Saratoga lest<br>
they feed the foe.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 480px; height: 400px;" alt="" src="images/152Pic.jpg"><br>
The Encounter between Tarleton and Colonel Washington.<br>
<br>
<br>
And matchless Dan Morgan of Virginia, with his band of riflemen, tall,<br>
sinewy fellows, in hunting-shirts, leggins, and moccasins, each with<br>
hatchet, hunter's knife, and rifle, dead sure to hit a man's head every<br>
time at two hundred and fifty yards. It was one of these men who shot<br>
the gallant Briton, Fraser, at Bemis's Heights. Morgan became the ablest<br>
leader of light troops then living. How gallantly he headed the forlorn<br>
hope under the icy walls of Quebec, where he was taken prisoner, and at<br>
Saratoga with his shrill whistle and stentorian voice called his<br>
dauntless braves where the fight was thickest! But Cowpens was Morgan's<br>
crowning feat. Inspiring militia and veterans alike with a courage they<br>
had never felt before, he routs Tarleton's trained band of horse, and<br>
then, skilful in retreat as he had been bold in fight, laughs at baffled<br>
Cornwallis's rage.<br>
<br>
Gladly would one form fuller acquaintance with other Revolutionary<br>
leaders: Stirling, Sullivan, Sumter, Mad Anthony Wayne, of Monmouth and<br>
Stony Point fame, Glover with his brave following of&nbsp; Marblehead<br>
fishermen, who, able to row as well as shoot, manned the oars that<br>
critical night when General Washington crossed to Trenton. But space is<br>
too brief. Colonel Washington, the dashing cavalryman, was the Custer of<br>
the Revolution. All the patriot ladies idolized him. In a hot<br>
sword-fight with the Colonel, Tarleton had had three fingers nearly<br>
severed. Subsequently in conversation with a South Carolina lady<br>
Tarleton said: "Why do you ladies so lionize Colonel Washington? He is<br>
an ignorant fellow. He can hardly write his name." "But you are a<br>
witness that he can make his mark," was the reply.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 460px; height: 629px;" alt="" src="images/154Pic.jpg"><br>
DeKalb Wounded at Camden.<br>
<br>
<br>
DeKalb was an American, too--by adoption. It is related that he<br>
expostulated with Gates for fighting so unprepared at Camden, and that<br>
Gates intimated cowardice. "Tomorrow will tell, sir, who is the coward,"<br>
the old fellow rejoined. And tomorrow did tell. As the battle reddened,<br>
exit Gates from Camden and from fame. We have recounted elsewhere how<br>
like a bull De Kalb held the field. A monster British grenadier rushed<br>
on him, bayonet fixed. DeKalb parried, at the same time burying his<br>
sword in the grenadier's breast so deep that he was unable to extract<br>
it. Then seizing the dead man's weapon he fought on, thrusting right and<br>
left, till at last, overpowered by numbers, he slipped and fell,<br>
mortally hurt.<br>
<br>
Among the civilian heroes of the Revolution, Robert Morris, the<br>
financier, deserves exceeding praise. Now turning over the lead ballast<br>
of his ships for bullets, now raising $50,000 on his private credit and<br>
sending it to Washington in the nick of time, now leading the country<br>
back to specie payment in season to save the national credit, the<br>
Philadelphia banker aided the cause as much as the best general in the<br>
field.<br>
<br>
Faithful and successful envoys as Jay and John Adams were, the<br>
Revolution brought to light one, and only one, true master in the<br>
difficult art of diplomacy--Franklin. Wise with a lifetime's shrewd<br>
observation, venerable with years, preceded by his fame as scientist and<br>
Revolutionary statesman, grand in his plain dignity, the Philadelphia<br>
printer stood unabashed before the throne of France, and carried king<br>
and diplomats with an art that surprised Europe's best-trained<br>
courtiers. Never missing an opportunity, he yet knew, by delicate<br>
intuition, when to speak and when to hold his tongue. Through<br>
concession, intrigue, and delay, his resolute will kept steady to its<br>
purpose. To please by yielding is easy. To carry one's point and be<br>
pleasing still, requires genius. This Franklin did--how successfully,<br>
our treaty of alliance with France and our treaty of peace with England<br>
splendidly attested.<br>
<br>
Towering above Revolutionary soldier, general, and statesman stands a<br>
figure summing up in himself all these characters and much more. That<br>
figure is George Washington, the most perfect human personality the<br>
world has known. Washington's military ability has been much underrated.<br>
He was hardly more First in Peace than First in War. That he had<br>
physical courage and could give orders calmly while bullets whizzed all<br>
about, one need not repeat. He was strategist and tactician too. Trenton<br>
and Yorktown do not cover his whole military record. With troops<br>
inferior in every single respect except natural valor, he<br>
out-generalled Howe in 1776, and he almost never erred when acting upon<br>
his own good judgment instead of yielding to Congress or to his<br>
subordinates. His movements on the Delaware even such a captain as<br>
Frederick the Great declared "the most brilliant achievements in the<br>
annals of military action." Washington advised against the attempt to<br>
hold Fort Washington, which failed; against the Canada campaign, which<br>
failed; against Gates for commander in the South, who failed; and in<br>
favor of Greene for that post, who succeeded. His army was indeed driven<br>
back in several battles, but never broken up. At Monmouth his plan was<br>
perfect, and it seems that he must have captured Clinton but for the<br>
treason of Charles Lee, set, by Congress's wish, to command the van.<br>
Indeed, of Washington's military career, "take it all in all, its long<br>
duration, its slender means, its vast theatre, its glorious aims and<br>
results, there is no parallel in history." [Footnote: Winthrop,<br>
Washington Monument Oration. February 23, 1885.]<br>
<br>
Yet we are right in never thinking of the Great Man first as a soldier,<br>
he was so much besides. Washington's consummate intellectual trait was<br>
sound judgment, only matched by the magnificent balance which subsisted<br>
between his mental and his moral powers. "George had always been a good<br>
son," his mother said. Nature had endowed him with intense passions and<br>
ambitions, but neither could blind him or swerve him one hair from the<br>
line of rectitude as he saw it. And he made painful and unremitting<br>
effort to see it and see it correctly. He was approachable, but repelled<br>
familiarity, and whoever attempted this was met with a perfectly<br>
withering look. He rarely laughed, and he was without humor, though he<br>
wrote and conversed well. He had the integrity of Aristides. His account<br>
with Congress while general shows scrupulousness to the uttermost<br>
farthing. To subordinate, to foe, even to malicious plotters against<br>
him, he was almost guiltily magnanimous. He loved popularity, yet, if<br>
conscious that he was right, would face public murmuring with heart of<br>
flint. Became the most famous man alive, idolized at home, named by<br>
every tongue in Europe, praised by kings and great ministers, who<br>
compared him with Caesar, Charlemagne, and Alfred the Great, his head<br>
swam not, but with steadfast heart and mind he moved on in the simple<br>
pursuit of his country's weal. "In Washington's career," said Fisher<br>
Ames, "mankind perceived some change in their ideas of greatness; the<br>
splendor of power, and even the name of conqueror had grown dim in their<br>
eyes." Lord Erskine wrote him: "You are the only being for whom I have<br>
an awful reverence." "Until time shall be no more," said Lord Brougham,<br>
"will a test of the progress which our race has made in Wisdom and<br>
Virtue be derived from the veneration paid to the immortal name of<br>
Washington." And Mr. Gladstone: "If among all the pedestals supplied by<br>
history for public characters of extraordinary nobility and purity I saw<br>
one higher than all the rest, and if I were required at a moment's<br>
notice to name the fittest occupant for it, my choice would light upon<br>
WASHINGTON." [Footnote: See Winthrop's Oration for these and other<br>
encomia.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
THE OLD CONFEDERATION<br>
<br>
[1781]<br>
<br>
The Revolutionary Congress was less a government than an exigency<br>
committee. It had no authority save in tacit general consent. Need of an<br>
express and permanent league was felt at an early date. Articles of<br>
Confederation, framed by Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, were adopted by<br>
Congress in November, 1777. They were then submitted to the State<br>
Legislatures for ratification. By the spring of 1779 all the States but<br>
Maryland had given their approval. Upon the accession of the latter, on<br>
March 1, 1781, the articles went into effect at once.<br>
<br>
The Confederation bound the States together into a "firm league of<br>
friendship" for common defence and welfare, and this "union" was to be<br>
"perpetual."&nbsp; Each State retained its "sovereignty" and
"independence,"<br>
as well as every power not "expressly delegated" to the central<br>
Government. Inhabitants of each State were entitled to all the<br>
privileges of citizens in the several States. Criminals fleeing from one<br>
State to another were to be returned.<br>
<br>
Congress was composed of delegates chosen annually, each State being<br>
represented by not less than two or more than seven. Each State had but<br>
one vote, whatever the number of its delegates.<br>
<br>
Taxation and the regulation of commerce were reserved to the State<br>
Governments. On the other hand, Congress alone could declare peace or<br>
war, make treaties, coin money, establish a post-office, deal with<br>
Indians outside of the States, direct the army, and appoint generals and<br>
naval officers. Many other things affecting all the States alike,<br>
Congress alone could do. It was to erect courts for trial of felonies<br>
and piracies on the high seas, and appoint judges for the settlement of<br>
disputes between the States. It was to make estimates for national<br>
expenses, and request of each State its quota of revenue.<br>
<br>
To amend the Articles, the votes of the entire thirteen States were<br>
demanded. Important lesser measures--such as those regarding war or<br>
peace, treaties, coinage, loans, appropriations--required the consent of<br>
nine States. Upon other questions a majority was sufficient. A<br>
committee, composed of one delegate from each State, was to sit during<br>
the recess of Congress, having the general superintendence of national<br>
affairs.<br>
<br>
The faults of the Confederation were numerous and great. Three<br>
outshadowed the rest: Congress could not enforce its will, could not<br>
collect a revenue, could not regulate commerce.<br>
<br>
Congress could not touch individuals; it must act through the State<br>
Governments, and these it had no power to coerce. Five States, for<br>
instance, passed laws which violated the treaty provision about payment<br>
of British creditors; yet Congress could do nothing but remonstrate.<br>
Hence its power to make treaties was almost a nullity. European nations<br>
did not wish to treat with a Government that could not enforce its<br>
promises.<br>
<br>
Congress could make requisition upon the States for revenue, but had no<br>
authority to collect a single penny. The States complied or not as they<br>
chose. In October, 1781, Congress asked for $8,000,000; in January,<br>
1783, it had received less than half a million. Lack of revenue made the<br>
Government continually helpless and often contemptible.<br>
<br>
Yet in spite of their looseness and other faults, the adoption of the<br>
Articles of Confederation was a forward step in American public law.<br>
Their greatest value was this: they helped to keep before the States the<br>
thought of union, while at the same time, by their very inefficiency,<br>
they proved the need of a stronger government to make union something<br>
more than a thought. The years immediately after the war were an<br>
extremely critical period. The colonies had indeed passed through the<br>
Red Sea, but the wilderness still lay before them. The great danger<br>
which had driven them into union being past, State pride and jealousy<br>
broke out afresh. "My State," not "my country," was the foremost thought<br>
in most minds. There was serious danger that each State would go its own<br>
way, and firm union come, if at all, only after years of weakness and<br>
disaster, if not of war. The unfriendly nations of Europe were eagerly<br>
anticipating such result. At this juncture the Articles of<br>
Confederation, framed during the war when union was felt to be<br>
imperative, did invaluable service. They solemnly committed the States<br>
to perpetual union. Their provisions for extradition of criminals and<br>
for inter-State citizenship helped to break down the barriers between<br>
State and State. Congress, by discharging its various duties on behalf<br>
of all the States, kept steadily before the public mind the idea of a<br>
national government, armed with at least a semblance of authority.<br>

<br>
The war had cost about $150,000,000. In 1783 the debt was<br>
$42,000,000--$8,000,000 owed in France and Holland, and the rest at<br>
home. The States contributed in so niggardly a way that even the<br>
interest could not be paid. Five millions were owing to the army. Deep<br>
and ominous discontent spread among officers and men. An obscure<br>
colonel, supposed to be the agent of more prominent men, wrote to<br>
Washington, advocating a monarchy as the only salvation for the country,<br>
and inviting him to become king. In the spring of 1783 an anonymous<br>
address, of menacing tone, was circulated in the army, calling upon it<br>
for measures to force its rights from an ungrateful country.<br>
<br>
[1785]<br>
<br>
That the army disbanded quietly at last, with only three months' pay, in<br>
certificates depreciated nine-tenths, was due almost wholly to the<br>
boundless influence of Washington. How powerless the Government would<br>
have been to resist an uprising of the army, was shown by a humiliating<br>
incident. In June, 1783, a handful of Pennsylvania troops, clamoring for<br>
their pay, besieged the doors of Congress, and that august body had to<br>
take refuge in precipitate flight.<br>
<br>
The country suffered greatly for lack of uniform commercial laws. So<br>
long as each State laid its own imposts, and goods free of duty in one<br>
State might be practically excluded from another, Congress could<br>
negotiate no valuable treaties of commerce abroad.<br>
<br>
The chief immediate distress was from this wretchedness of our<br>
commercial relations, whether foreign or between the States at home. If<br>
our fathers would be independent, king and parliament were determined to<br>
make them pay dearly for the privilege. Accordingly Great Britain laid<br>
tariffs upon all our exports thither. What was much harder to bear, an<br>
order of the king in council, July 2, 1783, utterly forbade American<br>
ships to engage in that British West-Indian trade which had always been<br>
a chief source of our wealth. The sole remedy for these abuses in<br>
dealing with England at that time was retaliation, but Congress had no<br>
authority to take retaliatory steps, while the separate States could not<br>
or would not act sufficiently in harmony to do so. If one imposed<br>
customs duties, another would open wide its ports, filling the markets<br>
of the first with British goods by overland trade, so that the customs<br>
law of the first availed nothing. If Pennsylvania and New York laid<br>
tariffs on foreign commodities, New Jersey and Connecticut people, in<br>
buying imported articles from Philadelphia or New York, were paying<br>
taxes to those greater States. North Carolina was in the same manner a<br>
forced tributary to South Carolina and Virginia, as were portions of<br>
Connecticut and Massachusetts to Rhode Island.<br>

<br>
<br>
We also needed a complete system of courts, departments for foreign and<br>
Indian affairs, and an efficient executive. The single vote for each<br>
State was unfair, allowing one-third of the people to defeat the will of<br>
the rest. The article requiring the consent of nine States made it<br>
almost impossible to get important measures through Congress. Delegates<br>
should not have been paid by their respective States. In consequence of<br>
this provision, coupled with other things, Congress decreased in numbers<br>
and importance. In November, 1783, less than twenty delegates were<br>
present, representing but seven States, and Congress had to appeal to<br>
the recreant States to send back their representatives before the treaty<br>
of peace could be ratified.<br>
<br>
[1787]<br>
<br>
But the one grand defect of the Confederation, underlying all others,<br>
was lack of power. The Government was an engine without steam. The<br>
States, just escaped from the tyranny of a king, would brook no new<br>
authority strong enough to endanger their liberties. The result was a<br>
thin ghost of a government set in charge over a lot of lusty<br>
flesh-and-blood States.<br>
<br>
The Confederation, however, did one piece of solid work worthy of<br>
everlasting praise. The Northwest Territory, embracing what is now Ohio,<br>
Indiana. Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had been ceded to the Union<br>
by the States which originally claimed it. July 13, 1787, Congress<br>
adopted for the government of the territory the famous Ordinance of<br>
1787. It provided for a governor, council, and judges, to be appointed<br>
by Congress, and a house of representatives elected by the people. Its<br>
shining excellence was a series of compacts between the States and the<br>
territory, which guaranteed religious liberty, made grants of land and<br>
other liberal provisions for schools and colleges, and forever<br>
prohibited slavery in the territory or the States which should be made<br>
out of it. Thus were laid broad and deep the foundation for the full and<br>
free development of humanity in a region larger than the whole German<br>
Empire.<br>
<br>
The passing of the Ordinance was probably due in large measure to the<br>
influence of the Ohio Company, a colonist society organized in Boston<br>
the year before. It was composed of the flower of the Revolutionary<br>
army, and had wealth, energy, and intelligence. When its agent appeared<br>
before Congress to arrange for the purchase of five million acres of<br>
land in the Ohio Valley, a bill for the government of the territory,<br>
containing neither the antislavery clause nor the immortal principles of<br>
the compacts, was on the eve of passage. The Company, composed mostly of<br>
Massachusetts men, strongly desired their future home to be upon free<br>
soil. Their influence prevailed with Congress, eager for revenue from<br>
the sale of lands, and even the Southern members voted unanimously for<br>
the remodelled ordinance. The establishment of a strong and enlightened<br>
government in the territory led to its rapid settlement. Marietta, 0.,<br>
was founded in April, 1788, and other colonies followed in rapid<br>
succession.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION<br>
<br>
[1787]<br>
<br>
The anarchy succeeding the Revolution was as sad as the Revolution<br>
itself had been glorious. The Articles of Confederation furnished<br>
practically no government with which foreign nations could deal; England<br>
still clung to the western posts, contrary to the treaty of peace, with<br>
no power anywhere on this side to do more than protest; the debt of the<br>
confederacy steadily piled up its unpaid interest; the land was flooded<br>
with irredeemable paper money, state and national; the confederacy's<br>
laws and constitution were ignored or trampled upon everywhere; and the<br>
arrogance and self-seeking of the several States surpassed everything<br>
but their own contemptible weakness.<br>
<br>
In 1786 Shays' rebellion broke out in Massachusetts. Solid money was<br>
very scarce, and paper all but worthless, yet many debts contracted on a<br>
paper basis were pressed for payment in hard money. The farmers swore<br>
that the incidence of taxes upon them was excessive, and upon the<br>
merchants too light. But the all-powerful grievance was the sudden<br>
change from the distressing monetary injustice during the Revolution,<br>
with the consequent increase of debts, to a rigid enforcement of<br>
debtors' claims afterward. At this period men were imprisoned for debt,<br>
and all prisons were frightful holes, which one would as lief die as<br>
enter. Meetings were held to air the popular griefs, and grew violent.<br>
<br>
In August the court-house at Northampton was seized by a body of armed<br>
men and the court prevented from sitting. Similar uprisings occurred at<br>
Worcester, Springfield, and Concord. The leader in these movements was<br>
Daniel Shays, a former captain in the continental army. Governor Bowdoin<br>
finally called for volunteers to put down the rebellion, and placed<br>
General Lincoln in command. After several minor engagements, in which<br>
the insurgents were worsted, the decisive action took place at<br>
Petersham, where, in February, 1787, the rebels were surprised by<br>
Lincoln. A large number were captured, many more fled to their homes,<br>
and the rest withdrew into the neighboring States. Vermont and Rhode<br>
Island alone offered them a peaceful retreat, the other States giving up<br>
the fugitives to Massachusetts.<br>
<br>
<br>

A Scene at Springfield, during Shays' Rebellion, when the<br>
mob attempted to prevent the holding of the Courts of Justice.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Shays commotion, for a long time shaking one of the stanchest States<br>
in the Confederation, well showed the need of a far stronger central<br>
government than the old had been or could be made. Other influences<br>
concurred to the same conviction. Washington's influence, which took<br>
effect mainly through his inspired letter to the States on leaving the<br>
army, was one of these. National feeling was also furthered by the<br>
spread of two religious sects, the Baptists and the Methodists, up and<br>
down the continent, whose missionary preachers, ignoring State lines and<br>
prejudices, helped to destroy the latter in their hearers.<br>
<br>
[1785]<br>
<br>
During the Revolution, American Methodism had been an appanage of<br>
England.&nbsp; Wesley had discountenanced our effort at independence,
and<br>
when war broke out, all the Methodist preachers left the country, save<br>
Asbury, who secreted himself somewhere in Delaware, waiting for better<br>
days. But in 1784 this zealous body of Christians was organized as an<br>
American affair, its clergy and laity after this displaying loyalty of<br>
the most approved kind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 357px; height: 450px;" alt="" src="images/178Pic.jpg"><br>
John Wesley.<br>
<br>
<br>
Schemes had been mooted looking to a changed political order. A<br>
proposition for a convention of the States to reform the Confederation<br>
passed the New York Legislature in July, 1782, under the influence of<br>
Alexander Hamilton; another passed that of Massachusetts, July, 1785,<br>
urged by Governor Bowdoin; but because of too great love for state<br>
independence and too little appreciation as yet of the serious nature of<br>
the crisis, both motions failed of effect.<br>
<br>
The idea of reform which found most favor, the only one which at first<br>
had any chance of getting itself realized, was that of giving Congress<br>
simply the additional power of regulating commerce. Even so moderate a<br>
proposal as this had many enemies, especially in the South. Greatly to<br>
her credit therefore as a Southern State, the purpose of amending the<br>
old Articles in the direction indicated was first taken up in earnest by<br>
Virginia. Her Legislature, soon after opening session in October, 1785,<br>
listened to memorials from Norfolk, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Alexandria,<br>
upon the gloomy prospects of American trade, which led to a general<br>
debate upon the subject. In this, Mr. Madison, by a speech far exceeding<br>
in ability any other that was made, began that extended and memorable<br>
career of efforts for enlarged function in our central government which<br>
has earned him the title of the Father of the Constitution.<br>
<br>
The result of this discussion was a bill directing the Virginia<br>
delegation in Congress to propose amendment to the constitution giving<br>
to Congress the needed additional power. The enemies of the bill,<br>
however, succeeded in so modifying it by limiting the proposed grant of<br>
power to a period of thirteen years, that Madison and its other abettors<br>
turned against it and voted to lay it on the table.<br>
<br>
There was in existence at this very time&nbsp; a joint commission<br>
representing Virginia and Maryland, which had been raised for the<br>
purpose of determining what jurisdiction each of the two States had over<br>
the Potomac and in Chesapeake Bay. Madison was one of the Virginia<br>
commissioners. A meeting had been held on March 17, 1785, at which the<br>
commissioners agreed in their report to transcend their instructions and<br>
to recommend to the two States uniform monetary and commercial<br>
regulations entire, including common export and import duties. They thus<br>
reported, adding the still further recommendation that commissioners to<br>
work out the details of such a plan be appointed each year till it<br>
should be completed. The Maryland Legislature adopted the report, adding<br>
the proposition that Delaware and Pennsylvania also should be invited to<br>
enter the system and to send commissioners.<br>
<br>
When the commissioners' report, with Maryland's action thereon, came<br>
before the Virginia Legislature, Madison moved, as a substitute for the<br>
mutilated bill which had been tabled previously, that the invitation to<br>
take part in the commission go to all the States. The motion passed by a<br>
large majority.<br>
<br>
[1786]<br>
<br>
Thus originated the Annapolis Convention of 1786. Nine States appointed<br>
delegates; all but Connecticut, Maryland, and the two Carolinas; but of<br>
the nine only Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York<br>
actually sent them. As the powers granted the commissioners presupposed<br>
a deputation from each of the States, those present, after mature<br>
deliberation, deemed it inadvisable to proceed, drawing up instead an<br>
urgent address to the States to take "speedy measures" for another,<br>
fuller, convention to meet on the second Monday of May, 1787, for the<br>
same purposes as had occasioned this one. Such was the mode in which the<br>
memorable Federal Convention came about. Its seat was Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
[1787]<br>
<br>
The second Monday of May, 1787, which should have witnessed the opening,<br>
was the 14th, but on that day too few deputies had assembled. So late as<br>
the 25th only nine States were represented. They, however, effected an<br>
organization on the 25th and chose officers. On the 28th eleven States<br>
were present, so that on the next day business began in earnest.<br>
Governor Randolph read and expounded the Virginia plan for a new<br>
government, and Charles Pinckney the South Carolina plan. Both of these<br>
were referred to a committee of the whole to sit next day.<br>
<br>
This Virginia plan was substantially the work of Madison, and was the<br>
earliest sketch of the present Constitution of the United States. With<br>
the Pinckney plan, it was worked over, debated, and amended in the<br>
committee of the whole, until June 13th, on which day the committee rose<br>
and reported to the Convention nineteen resolutions based almost wholly<br>
upon the Virginia plan. These were the text for all the subsequent<br>
doings of the Convention.<br>
<br>
The so-called New Jersey plan was brought forward on June 15th, the gist<br>
of it being a recurrence to the foolish idea of merely repairing the<br>
Confederation that then was. Its strength, which was slight, consisted<br>
in its accord with the letter of the credentials which the delegates had<br>
brought. It was, however, emphatically rejected, the Convention<br>
stretching instructions, ignoring the old government, and proceeding to<br>
build from the foundations. On July 24th and 26th the resolutions, now<br>
increased to twenty-three, were put in the hands of a committee of<br>
detail to be reported back in the form of a constitution. They<br>
reappeared in this shape on August 6th, and this new document was<br>
henceforth the basis of discussion. On September 8th a new committee was<br>
appointed to revise style and arrangement, and brought in its work<br>
September 13th, after which additions and changes were few. The<br>
Constitution received signature September 17th.<br>
<br>
The Federal Convention of 1787 was the most remarkable gathering in all<br>
our national history thus far. Sixty-five delegates were elected, but as<br>
ten never attended, fifty-five properly made up the body. Even these<br>
were at no time all present together. From July 5th to August 13th New<br>
York was not represented. Rhode Island was not represented at all.<br>
Washington was President; Franklin, aged eighty-one, the oldest member;<br>
Gillman, of New Hampshire, aged twenty-five, the youngest. Each State<br>
sent its best available talent, so that the foremost figures then in<br>
American political life were present, the chief exceptions being John<br>
Adams, Jefferson--both abroad at the time--Samuel Adams, not favorable<br>
to the Convention, John Jay, and Patrick Henry. Eight of the members had<br>
signed the great Declaration, six the Articles of Confederation, seven<br>
the Annapolis appeal of 1786. Washington and a good half dozen others<br>
had been conspicuous military leaders in the Revolution. Five had been<br>
or still were governors of their respective States. Nearly all had held<br>
important offices of one sort or another. Forty of the fifty-five had<br>
been in Congress, a large proportion of them coming to the Convention<br>
directly from the congressional session just ended in New York.<br>
<br>
It is interesting to note how high many from this Constituent Assembly<br>
rose after the adoption of the paper which they had indited. Washington<br>
and Madison became Presidents, Gerry Vice-President, Langdon senator and<br>
President of the Senate, with duty officially to notify him who was<br>
already First in War that the nation had made him also First in Peace.<br>
Langdon was candidate for Vice-President in 1809. Randolph was the<br>
earliest United States Attorney-General, Hamilton earliest Secretary of<br>
the Treasury, M'Henry third Secretary of War, succeeding General Knox.<br>
Dayton was a representative from New Jersey in the IId, IIId, IVth, and<br>
Vth Congresses, being Speaker during the last, then senator in the VIth,<br>
VIIth, and VIIIth. Ellsworth and Johnson were Connecticut's first pair<br>
of senators, Johnson passing in 1791 to the presidency of Columbia<br>
College, Ellsworth to the national chief-justiceship to succeed Jay.<br>
Rutledge was one of the first associate justices of the Supreme Court.<br>
Subsequently, in July, 1795, Washington nominated him for chief justice,<br>
and he actually presided over the Supreme Court at its term in that<br>
year; but, for his ill-mannered denunciation of Jay's treaty, the Senate<br>
declined to confirm him. Wilson and Patterson also each held the<br>
position of associate justice on the supreme bench of the nation.<br>
<br>
Rufus King, after the adoption of the Constitution, removed to New York.<br>
He was a senator from that State between 1789 and 1795, and again<br>
between 1813 and 1826; and Minister to England from 1796 to 1803, and<br>
again after 1826 till his failing health compelled his resignation. He<br>
was the federalist candidate for Vice-President in 1804 and 1808, and<br>
for President in 1816. Sherman of Connecticut, Gillman of New Hampshire,<br>
and Baldwin of Georgia, went into the House of Representatives
and&nbsp; were<br>
promoted thence to the Senate. Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, Gouverneur<br>
Morris, now again of New York, Caleb Strong of Massachusetts, William<br>
Patterson of New Jersey, Richard Bassett of Delaware, Alexander Martin<br>
and Blount of North Carolina, Charles Pinckney and Butler of South<br>
Carolina, and Colonel Few of Georgia, all became senators. Madison,<br>
Gerry, Fitzsimmons of Pennsylvania, Carroll of Maryland, and Spaight and<br>
Williamson of North Carolina, all wrought well in the House, but did not<br>
reach the Senate. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney was nominated for the<br>
Presidency in 1800, on the ticket with John Adams, again in 1804, and<br>
still again in 1808.<br>
<br>
Jared Ingersoll was the federalist candidate for Vice-President in 1812,<br>
on the ticket with De Witt Clinton, against Madison and Gerry. Yates<br>
rose to be Chief Justice of the State of New York, Lansing to be its<br>
Chancellor. Gerry and Strong of Massachusetts, Patterson of New Jersey,<br>
Bassett of Delaware, Spaight and Davie of North Carolina, and Charles<br>
Pinckney of South Carolina, became Governors of their States, as did<br>
Alexander Martin, of North Carolina, a second time.<br>
<br>
Having received final revision and signature, the Constitution was<br>
transmitted, with a commendatory letter from Washington, to the old<br>
Congress. Suggestions were added relating to the mode of launching it.<br>
Congress was requested to lay the new Great Charter before the States,<br>
and, so soon as it should have been ratified by nine of them, to fix the<br>
date for the election by these of presidential electors, the day for the<br>
latter to cast their votes, and the time and place for commencing<br>
proceedings under the revised constitution. Congress complied. The<br>
debates of the Convention, only more hot, attended ratification, which<br>
was carried in several States only by narrow majorities.<br>
<br>
[1788-1790]<br>
<br>
Delaware was the first to ratify, December 7, 1787. Pennsylvania and New<br>
Jersey soon followed, the one on the 12th of the same month, the other<br>
on the 18th. Delaware and New Jersey voted unanimously; Pennsylvania<br>
ratified by a vote of forty-six to twenty-three. During the first month<br>
of the new year, 1788, Georgia and Connecticut ratified, on the 2d and<br>
9th respectively. New Hampshire next took up the question, but adjourned<br>
her convention to await the action of Massachusetts. In this great State<br>
the people were divided almost equally. Of the western counties the<br>
entire population that had sympathized or sided with Shays was bitter<br>
against the Constitution. The larger centres and in general the eastern<br>
part of the State favored it. The vote was had on February 6th, and<br>
showed a majority of only 19 out of 355 in favor of the Constitution.<br>
<br>
<br>

Celebrating the Adoption of the Constitution in New York.<br>
<br>
<br>
The good work still remained but half done. It was a crisis.<br>
Accordingly, early in this year, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay published<br>
their weighty articles, since collected in the immortal volume known as<br>
"The Federalist." These discussions seemed to have much effect. Maryland<br>
ratified on April 28th, and South Carolina on May 23d. New Hampshire<br>
fell into line, the necessary ninth State to ratify, June 21st. Thus the<br>
Constitution became binding, yet it was still painfully uncertain what<br>
the action of Virginia and New York would be. In both States the<br>
Constitution was opposed by many of the most influential men, and after<br>
a long and heated canvass adoption occurred in Virginia by a majority of<br>
only ten in a vote of 168; in New York by the narrow majority of two.<br>
Even now North Carolina and Rhode Island remained aloof. The former, not<br>
liking the prospect of isolation, came into the Union November 21, 1789,<br>
after the new government had been some time at work. Rhode Island, owing<br>
to her peculiar history in the matter of religious liberty, which she<br>
feared a closer union would jeopardize, as well as to the strength of<br>
the paper-money fanaticism within her borders, was more obdurate. The<br>
chief difficulty here was to get the legislature to call a convention.<br>
The New York Packet of February 20, 1790, in a letter from Rhode Island,<br>
tells how this was accomplished. Among the anti-adoptionists in the<br>
senate was a rural clergyman who, prompted by his conscience, or, as one<br>
account runs, by exhortation and the offer of a conveyance by an<br>
influential member of the adoption party, was, when Sunday came, absent<br>
upon his sacred work. The occasion was seized for a ballot. The senate<br>
was a tie, but the Governor threw the casting vote for a convention.<br>
This was called as soon as possible, and on May 29, 1790, Rhode Island,<br>
too, at the eleventh hour, made the National Constitution her own. Not<br>
only had a MORE PERFECT UNION been formed at last, but it included all<br>
the Old Thirteen States.<br>

<br>
1789-1814<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
THE NEW GOVERNMENT<br>
<br>
Notified on July 2, 1788, that nine States had voted approval of the<br>
Constitution, Congress, on September 13th, set the first Wednesday in<br>
January, 1789, for the choice of electors, the first in February for<br>
their ballot, and the first in March for putting the new government in<br>
motion. The first Wednesday in March, 1789, happening to fall on the<br>
4th, this date has since remained as the initial one for presidencies<br>
and congresses. The First Congress had no quorum in either branch on<br>
March 4th, and did not complete its organization till April 6th.<br>
Washington was inaugurated on April 30th, in New York, where the First<br>
Congress, proceeding to execute the Constitution, held its entire first<br>
session. Its second session was in Philadelphia, the seat of Congress<br>
thence till the second session of the VIth Congress, 1800, since which<br>
time Congress has always met in Washington.<br>
<br>
The inauguration of our first President was an imposing event. As the<br>
hero moved from his house on Franklin Square, through Pearl Street to<br>
Broad, and through Broad to Federal Hall, corner of Wall Street, people<br>
thronged every sidewalk, door-way, window, and roof along the entire<br>
line of march. About him on the platform after his arrival stood John<br>
Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Baron Steuben, Generals St. Clair and Knox,<br>
Roger Sherman, and Chancellor Livingston. Washington advanced to the<br>
rail, placed his hand upon his breast, and, bowing low, said audibly, as<br>
the Chancellor in his robes solemnly recited the words, "I swear, so<br>
help me God," reverently kissing the Bible as if to add solemnity to his<br>
oath. "It is done," cried the Chancellor; "long live George Washington,<br>
President of the United States!" The great crowd repeated the cry. It<br>
was echoed outside in the city, off into the country, far north, far<br>
south, till the entire land took up that watchword, which his own<br>
generation has passed on to ours and to all that shall come, Long live<br>
George Washington!<br>
<br>
Let us study for a moment the habitat of the people over which the new<br>
Chief Magistrate was called to bear sway. By the census of 1790, the<br>
population of the thirteen States and of the territory belonging to the<br>
Union numbered 3,929,214. It resided almost wholly on the Atlantic coast<br>
from Maine to Florida. Not more than five per cent of it was west of the<br>
mountains. The line of inner settlement, now farther, now nearer, ran at<br>
an average distance from the coast of two hundred and fifty-five miles.<br>
The coast land of Massachusetts, southern New England, and New York was<br>
the most densely covered. The Hudson Valley was well peopled as far as<br>
Albany. Farms and hamlets were to be met all the way from New York<br>
across New Jersey to the Delaware, and far up the Delaware Valley<br>
westward from that river. Maine, still belonging to Massachusetts, had<br>
few settlements except upon her coast and a little way inland along her<br>
great rivers. Vermont, not yet a State and claimed by both New Hampshire<br>
and New York, was well filled up, as was all New Hampshire but the<br>
extreme north.<br>
<br>
The westward movement of population took mainly four routes, the Mohawk<br>
and Ontario, the Upper Potomac, the Southwestern Virginia, and the<br>
Western Georgia. The Mohawk Valley was settled, and pioneers had taken<br>
up much land on Lake Ontario and near the rivers and lakes tributary to<br>
it. Elmira and Binghamton had been begun. Pennsylvania settlers had<br>
pressed westward more or less thickly to the lower elevations of the<br>
Alleghanies, while beyond, in the Pittsburgh regions, they were even<br>
more numerous. What is now West Virginia had squatters here and there.<br>
Virginian pioneers had also betaken themselves southwestward to the head<br>
of the Tennessee. North and South Carolina were inhabited as far west as<br>
the mountains, though the population was not dense. In Northern<br>
Kentucky, along the Ohio, lay considerable settlements, and in<br>
Tennessee, where Nashville now is, there was another centre of<br>
civilization. In the Northwest Territory, Detroit, Vincennes, Kaskaskia,<br>
Prairie du Chien, Mackinac, and Green River were outposts, at each of<br>
which a few white men might have been found.<br>

The first New York City Directory appeared in 1786. It had eight hundred<br>
and forty-six names, not going above Roosevelt and Cherry Streets on<br>
the East side, or Dey Street on the West. There were then in the city<br>
three Dutch Reformed churches, four Presbyterian, three Episcopal, two<br>
German Lutheran, and one congregation each belonging to the Catholics,<br>
Friends, Baptists, Moravians, and Jews. In 1789 the Methodists had two<br>
churches, and the Friends two new Meetings. The houses in the city were<br>
generally of brick, with tile roofs, mostly English in style, but a few<br>
Dutch. The old Fort, where the provincial governors had resided, still<br>
stood in the Battery. The City Hall was a brick structure, three stories<br>
high, with wings, fronting on Broad Street. Want of good water greatly<br>
inconvenienced the citizens, as there was no aqueduct yet, and wells<br>
were few. Most houses supplied themselves by casks from a pump on what<br>
is now Pearl Street, this being replenished from a pond a mile north of<br>
the then city limits. New York commanded the trade of nearly all<br>
Connecticut, half New Jersey, and all Western Massachusetts, besides<br>
that of New York State itself. In short it did the importing for<br>
one-sixth of the population of the Union. Pennsylvania and Maryland made<br>
the best flour. In the manufacture of iron, paper, and cabinet ware,<br>
Pennsylvania led all the States.<br>
<br>
Over this rapidly growing portion of the human race in its widely<br>
separated homes there was at last a central government worthy the name.<br>
The old Articles of Confederation had been no fundamental law, not a<br>
foundation but a homely botch-work of superstructure, resembling more a<br>
treaty between several States than a ground-law for one. In the new<br>
Constitution a genuine foundation was laid, the Government now holding<br>
direct and immediate relations with each subject of every State, and<br>
citizens of States being at the same time citizens of the United States.<br>
Hitherto the central power could act on individuals only through States.<br>
Now, by its own marshals, aided if need were by its army, it could<br>
itself arrest and by its own&nbsp; courts try and condemn any
transgressor of<br>
its laws.<br>
<br>
But if the State relinquished the technical sovereignty which it had<br>
before, it did not sink to the level of an administrative division, but<br>
increased rather in all the elements of real dignity and stability. Over<br>
certain subjects the new constitution gave the States supreme, absolute,<br>
and uncontrollable power. The range of this supreme state prerogative<br>
is, in fact, wider on the whole than that of national. For national<br>
action there must be demonstrable constitutional warrant, for that of<br>
States this is not necessary. In more technical phrase: to the United<br>
States what is not granted is denied, to the State what is not denied is<br>
granted. It is a perpetual reminder of original state sovereignty, that<br>
no State can without its consent be deprived of its equal suffrage in<br>
the Senate. Each State also must have at least one representative.<br>
States cannot be sued by private persons or corporations. Even upon<br>
subjects constitutionally reserved for national law, if Congress has not<br>
legislated state statute is valid.<br>
<br>
Precisely as its advocates had prophesied, this revised order worked<br>
well, bringing a blessed new feeling of security. On commerce and<br>
business it conferred immense benefits, which rapidly became<br>
disseminated through all classes of the population. The sense and<br>
appearance of unity and consequent strength which the land had enjoyed<br>
in the early days of the Revolution came back in greater completeness,<br>
and was most gratifying to all. There was still a rankling hatred toward<br>
England, and men hostile to central government on other grounds were<br>
reconciled to it as the sole condition of successful commercial or naval<br>
competition with that country.<br>
<br>
The consequence was a wide-spread change of public feeling in reference<br>
to the Constitution very soon after its adoption. Bitterest hostility<br>
turned to praise that was often fulsome, reducing to insignificance an<br>
opposition that had probably comprised a popular majority during the<br>
very months of ratification. Many shifted their ground merely to be on<br>
the popular side. With multitudes Washington's influence had more weight<br>
than any argument.<br>
<br>
The Constitution's unfortunate elasticity of interpretation also for the<br>
time worked well. People who had fought it saw how their cherished views<br>
could after all be based upon it. All parties soon began, therefore, to<br>
swear by the Constitution as their political Bible. The fathers of the<br>
immortal paper were exalted into demigods. Fidelity to the Constitution<br>
came to be pre-eminently the watchword of those till now against its<br>
adoption. They in fact shouted this cry louder than the Federalists, who<br>
had never regarded it a perfect instrument of government. It came to<br>
pass ere long that nothing would blast a public measure so instantly or<br>
so completely as the cry of its unconstitutionality.<br>

<br>
Few can form any idea of the herculean work performed by the First<br>
Congress in setting up and starting our present governmental machinery.<br>
The debt which we owe the public men of that time is measureless. With<br>
such care and wisdom did they proceed, that little done by them has<br>
required alteration, the departments having run on decade after decade<br>
till now essentially in their original grooves. The Senate formed itself<br>
into its three classes, so that one-third of its members, and never more<br>
than this, should retire at a time. Four executive departments were<br>
created, those of State, the Treasury, War, and the<br>
Attorney-Generalship. The first occupants were, respectively, Jefferson,<br>
Hamilton, Knox, and Randolph.<br>
<br>
Of the present departments of government the post-office alone has come<br>
down from colonial times, Benjamin Franklin having been general<br>
superintendent thereof under the British Government. He was re-appointed<br>
by the second Continental Congress, in July, 1775. The First Congress<br>
under the Constitution erected a general post-office, but its head<br>
attained the dignity of a regular cabinet officer not till about 1830,<br>
and then only by custom. To begin with, in fact, there was strictly no<br>
cabinet in the modern sense. Washington's habit was to consult his<br>
ministers separately.<br>
<br>
Under the Articles of Confederation there had been a treasury board of<br>
several commissioners, and a superintendent of finance. The new<br>
arrangement, making one man responsible, was a great improvement. A law<br>
was passed forbidding the Secretary of the Treasury to be concerned in<br>
trade or commerce, that is, to be a merchant. The late A. T. Stewart,<br>
appointed by President Grant to the office, was rejected as ineligible<br>
under this law. Yet no department of our Government has had a finer<br>
record than the Treasury.<br>
<br>
Not only had the First Congress to vote revenue, but to make provision<br>
for the collection of this. Revenue districts had to be mapped out, the<br>
proper officers appointed, and light-houses, buoys, and public piers<br>
arranged for along the whole coast.&nbsp; Salaries were to be fixed,
and a<br>
multitude of questions relating to the interpretation and application of<br>
the Constitution to be solved by patient deliberation. The United States<br>
Mint was erected, and our so felicitous monetary system, based upon the<br>
decimal principle along with the binary, established in place of the<br>
desperate monetary chaos prevailing before. Hitherto there were four<br>
sorts of colonial money of account all differing from sterling, while<br>
Mexican dollars and numberless other forms of foreign money were in<br>
actual circulation.<br>
<br>
The noblest part of all this work was the organization of the federal<br>
judiciary, through an act drawn up with extraordinary ability by Oliver<br>
Ellsworth of Connecticut. A Chief Justice--the first one was John<br>
Jay--and five associates were to constitute the Supreme Court. District<br>
courts were ordained, one per State and one each for Kentucky and Maine,<br>
not yet States; also three circuit courts, the eastern, the middle, and<br>
the southern; and the jurisdiction of each grade was accurately fixed.<br>
As yet there were no special circuit judges, nor, excepting the<br>
temporary ones of 1801, were there till some eighty years later. Clerks,<br>
marshals, and district-attorneys were part of this first arrangement.<br>
Originally the Attorney-General was little but an honorary officer. He<br>
kept his practice, had no public income but his fees, and resided where<br>
he pleased.<br>
<br>
As his title implies, the Secretary of War was to have charge of all the<br>
nation's means of offence and defence, there being until April 30, 1796,<br>
no separate secretary for the navy. We had indeed in 1789 little use for<br>
such a functionary, not a war-vessel then remaining in Government's<br>
possession. In 1784 our formidable navy consisted of a single ship, the<br>
Alliance, but the following year Congress ordered her sold.<br>
<br>
The senators most active in the creations just reviewed were Langdon,<br>
King, and Robert Morris, besides Ellsworth. In the House, Madison outdid<br>
all others in toil as in ability, though worthily seconded by<br>
distinguished men like Fisher Ames, Gerry, Clymer, Fitzsimmons,<br>
Boudinot, and Smith. The three Connecticut representatives, Sherman,<br>
Trumbull, and Wadsworth, made up perhaps the ablest state delegation in<br>
the body.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
FEDERALISM AND ANTI-FEDERALISM<br>
<br>
[1790]<br>
<br>
Early in the life of our Constitution two parties rose, which, under<br>
various names, have continued ever since. During the strife for and<br>
against adoption, those favoring this had been styled Federalists, and<br>
their opponents, Anti-Federalists. After adoption--no one any longer<br>
really antagonizing the Constitution--the two words little by little<br>
shifted their meaning, a man being dubbed Federalist or Anti-Federalist<br>
according to his preference for strong national government or for strong<br>
state governments. The Federalist Party gave birth to the Whig Party,<br>
and this to the modern Republican Party. The Anti-Federalists came to be<br>
called "Republicans," then "Democratic-Republicans," then simply<br>
"Democrats."<br>
<br>
The central plank of the federalist platform was vigorous single<br>
nationality. In aid of this the Federalists wished a considerable army<br>
and navy, so that the United States might be capable of ample<br>
self-defence against all foes abroad or at home. Partly as a means to<br>
this, partly to build up national feeling, unity, self-respect, and due<br>
respect for the nation abroad, they sought to erect our national credit,<br>
which had fallen so low, and to plant it on a solid and permanent basis.<br>
As still further advancing these ends they proposed so to enforce regard<br>
for the national authority and laws and obedience to them, that within<br>
its sphere the nation should be absolutely and beyond question paramount<br>
to the State.<br>
<br>
In many who cherished them these noble purposes were accompanied by a<br>
certain aristocratic feeling and manner, a carelessness of popular<br>
opinion, an inclination to model governmental polity and administration<br>
after the English, and an impatience with what was good in our native<br>
American ideas and ways, which, however natural, were unfortunate and<br>
unreasonable. Puffed up with pride at its victory in carrying the<br>
Constitution against the opposition of the ignorant masses, this party<br>
developed a haughtiness and a lack of republican spirit amounting in<br>
some cases to deficient patriotism.<br>
<br>
The early Federalists were of two widely different stripes. There were<br>
among them Washington, Adams, Hamilton, and Jay; and there were the<br>
interested and practical advocates of the same, made up of business men<br>
and the wealthy and leisurely classes, who, without intending to be<br>
selfish, were governed in political sympathy and action mainly by their<br>
own interests.<br>
<br>
The greatest early Anti-Federalists were Jefferson, Madison, and<br>
Randolph, all of whom had been ardent for the Constitution. The party as<br>
a whole, indeed, not only acquiesced in the re-creation of the general<br>
Government, but was devotedly friendly to the new order. But while<br>
Republicans admitted that a measure of governmental centralization was<br>
indispensable, they prized the individual State as still the main pillar<br>
of our political fabric, and were hence jealous of all increased<br>
function at the centre. It became more and more their theory that the<br>
States, rather than the individuals of the national body politic, had<br>
been the parties to the Constitution, so making this to be a compact<br>
like the old Articles, and the government under it a confederacy as<br>
before 1789.<br>
<br>
Another issue divided the parties, that between the strict and the more<br>
free interpretation of the Constitution--between the close<br>
constructionists and the liberal constructionists. The question dividing<br>
them was this: In matters relating to the powers of the general<br>
Government, ought any unclear utterance of the Constitution to be so<br>
explained as to enlarge those powers, or so as to confine them to the<br>
narrowest possible sphere? Each of the two tendencies in construction<br>
has in turn brought violence to our fundamental law, but the sentiment<br>
of nationality and the logic of events have favored liberality rather<br>
than narrowness in interpreting the parchment. When in charge of the<br>
government, even strict constructionists have not been able to carry out<br>
their theory. Thus Jefferson, to purchase Louisiana, was obliged, from<br>
his point of view, to transcend constitutional warrant; and Madison, who<br>
at first opposed such an institution as unconstitutional, ended by<br>
approving the law which chartered the Second United States Bank.<br>
<br>
The Federalists used to argue that Article I, Section VIII., the part of<br>
the Constitution upon which debate chiefly raged, could not have been<br>
intended as an exhaustive statement of congressional powers. The<br>
Government would be unable to exist, they urged, to say nothing of<br>
defending itself and accomplishing its work, unless permitted to do more<br>
than the eighteen things there enumerated. They further insisted that<br>
plain utterances of the Constitution presuppose the exercise by Congress<br>
of powers not specifically enumerated, explicitly authorizing that body<br>
to make all laws necessary for executing the enumerated powers "and all<br>
other powers vested in the Government of the United States or in any<br>
department or officer thereof."<br>
<br>
In reply the Anti-Federalists made much of the titles "United States,"<br>
"Federal," and the like, in universal use. They appealed to concessions<br>
as to the nature of our system made by statesmen of known national<br>
sympathies. Such concessions were plentiful then and much later. Even<br>
Webster in his immortal reply to Hayne calls ours a government of<br>
"strictly limited," even of "enumerated, specified, and particularized"<br>
powers. Two historical facts told powerfully for the anti-federalist<br>
theory. One was that the government previous to 1789 was unquestionably<br>
a league of States; the other was that many voted for the present<br>
Constitution supposing it to be a mere revision of the old. Had the<br>
reverse been commonly believed, adoption would have been more than<br>
doubtful.<br>
<br>

CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
DOMESTIC QUESTIONS OF WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATIONS<br>
<br>
[1790-1791]<br>
<br>
I. Tariff.--Upon declaring their independence the United States threw<br>
open their ports, inviting trade from all nations. During the Revolution<br>
foreign commerce had become an important interest, and at its close the<br>
inclination of all, the more so from memory of England's accursed<br>
navigation acts, would have been to leave it untrammelled. Several<br>
motives, however, induced resort to a restrictive policy which,<br>
beginning with 1789, and for years expected to be temporary, has been<br>
pursued with little deviation ever since. Of course the Government<br>
needed revenue, and the readiest means of securing this was a tax on<br>
imports. Rates were made low, averaging until 1808 only 11-1/4 per cent.<br>
As a consequence the revenues were large.<br>
<br>
The movers of this first tariff, especially Hamilton, also wished by<br>
means of it to make the central Government felt as a positive power<br>
throughout the land. It had this effect. All custom-houses passed to the<br>
United States, and United States officers appeared at every port, having<br>
an authority, in its kind, paramount to that of state functionaries.<br>
<br>
A stronger consideration still was to retaliate against England. In<br>
spite of America's political independence the old country was determined<br>
to retain for her merchant marine its former monopoly here. Orders in<br>
council practically limited all the commerce of England and her<br>
remaining colonies with this country to English ships, although, from<br>
the relations of the two lands and the nature of their productions, our<br>
chief foreign trade must still be with England. There was no way to meet<br>
this selfish policy but to show that it was a game which we too could<br>
play.<br>
<br>
Besides, however we behaved toward the mother-land, we needed to be<br>
prepared for war, because it was evident that George III. and his<br>
ministers had only too good a will to reduce us again to subjection if<br>
opportunity offered. Should we, by taxing imports, become independent in<br>
the production of war material, a fresh struggle for life would be much<br>
more hopeful than if we continued dependent upon foreign lands for<br>
military supplies.<br>
<br>
II. Funding the Debt.--In the first years after they had set up their<br>
new constitution the people of this country staggered under a terrible<br>
financial load. Besides the current expenses of Government, there were:<br>
1, the federal debt due abroad, over thirteen million dollars, including<br>
arrears; 2, the federal debt held at home, about forty-two and one-half<br>
million; 3, the state revolutionary debts, aggregating nearly<br>
twenty-five million. Each of these sums was largely made up of unpaid<br>
interest.<br>
<br>
The foreign debt Congress unanimously determined to pay in full. In<br>
respect to the domestic federal debt two opinions prevailed. Hamilton<br>
was for liquidating this also to the last copper. But these securities<br>
had mostly changed hands since issue, so that dollar for dollar payment<br>
would not advantage original holders but only speculators. As soon as<br>
Hamilton's recommendation became public this class of paper rose from<br>
about fifteen cents per dollar to fifty cents, and enterprising New York<br>
firms hurried their couriers, relay horses, and swift packets to remote<br>
parts of the Union to buy it up. Madison, supported by a strong party,<br>
proposed, therefore, to pay only original debtors at par, allowing<br>
secondary holders barely the highest market value previous to the<br>
opening of the question in Congress. He was overruled, however, and this<br>
part of the debt, too, was ordered paid according to its literal terms.<br>
<br>
Even the motion that the United States should assume and discharge the<br>
state debts finally prevailed, though against most violent and resolute<br>
opposition. This came especially from Virginia, who had gone far in the<br>
payment of her own war debt, and thought it unjust to have to help the<br>
delinquent States. Her objection was strengthened by the fact that most<br>
of the debt was owned in the North. The victory was secured by what is<br>
now termed a "deal," northern votes being promised in favor of a<br>
southern location for the national capital, in return for enough<br>
southern votes to pass the bill assuming state debts.<br>
<br>
These gigantic measures had origin in the mind of Hamilton. To many they<br>
appeared and appear today like a grand government job. But they worked<br>
well, laying the foundation of our national credit. Interest arrears and<br>
back installments of the foreign debt were to be paid at once with the<br>
proceeds of a fresh loan, supplemented by income from customs and<br>
tonnage. The remaining debt was to be refunded. Federal stocks shot up<br>
in value, moneyed interests became attached to the Government, and the<br>
nation began to be looked to as a more reliable bulwark of sound finance<br>
than any of the States.<br>

<br>
<br>
III. The Excise.--Unexpectedly productive as the tariff had proved,<br>
public income still fell short of what these vast operations required.<br>
Direct taxation or a higher tariff being out of the question, Hamilton<br>
proposed, and Congress voted, an excise on spirits, from nine to<br>
twenty-five cents a gallon if from grain, from eleven to thirty if from<br>
imported material, as molasses. Excise was a hated form of tax, and this<br>
measure awakened great opposition in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,<br>
and New England, and most of all in Pennsylvania, in whose western<br>
counties distilling was the staple industry.<br>
<br>
Here, far from the seats of power, even the state government had<br>
asserted itself little. The general Government was defied. A meeting in<br>
Washington County voted to regard as an enemy any person taking office<br>
under the excise law. September 6, 1791, a revenue officer was tarred<br>
and feathered. Other such cases followed. Secret societies were formed<br>
to oppose the law. Whippings and even murders resulted. At last there<br>
was a veritable reign of terror. The President proceeded slowly but with<br>
firmness, accounting this a good opportunity vividly to reveal to the<br>
people the might of the new Government. Militia and volunteers were<br>
called out, who arrived in the rebellious districts in November, 1794.<br>
Happily, their presence sufficed. The opposition faded away before them,<br>
not a shot being fired on either side.<br>

<br>
IV. The Bank.--The Secretary of the Treasury pleaded for a United States<br>
Bank as not only profitable to Government but indispensable to the<br>
proper administration of the national finances. Congress acquiesced, yet<br>
with so violent hostility on the part of many that before approving the<br>
Charter Act Washington required the written opinions of his official<br>
advisers. Jefferson powerfully opposed such an institution as<br>
unconstitutional, his acute argument being the arsenal whence close<br>
constructionists have gotten their weapons ever since. Randolph sided<br>
with Jefferson, Knox with Hamilton. The President at last signed,<br>
agreeing with Hamilton in the view that Congress, being the agent of a<br>
sovereignty, is not, within any sphere of action constitutionally open<br>
to it, shut up to specific or enumerated modes of attaining its ends,<br>
but has choice among all those that nations customarily use. The Supreme<br>
Court has proceeded on this doctrine ever since. The bank proved vastly<br>
advantageous. Three-fourths of every private subscription to its stock<br>
had to be in government paper, which raised this to par, while it<br>
naturally became the interest of all stockholders to maintain and<br>
increase the stability and credit of the Government.<br>
<br>

<br>
CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND<br>
<br>
[1793]<br>
<br>
In 1789 France adopted a constitution. Provoked at this, the friends of<br>
absolute monarchy withdrew from France, and incited the other powers of<br>
Europe to interpose in effort to restore to Louis XVI. his lost power.<br>
The result was that Louis lost his head as well as his power, and that<br>
France became a republic. War with all Europe followed, which elevated<br>
that matchless military genius, Napoleon Bonaparte, first to the head of<br>
France's armies, then to her throne, to be toppled thence in 1814,<br>
partly by his own indiscretions, partly by the forces combined against<br>
him.<br>
<br>
From the beginning to the end of this revolutionary period abroad,<br>
European politics determined American politics, home as well as foreign,<br>
causing dangerous embarrassment and complications. War having in<br>
February, 1793, been declared by England and France against each other,<br>
what attitude the United States should assume toward each became a<br>
pressing question. Washington's proclamation of neutrality, April 22,<br>
1793, in effect, though not so meant, annulled our treaty of 1778 with<br>
France, which bound us to certain armed services to that monarchy in<br>
case of a rupture between her and England. Washington's paper alleged<br>
that "the duty and interests of the United States" required<br>
impartiality, and assumed "to declare the disposition of the United<br>
States to observe" this.<br>
<br>
"The proclamation," wrote Jefferson, "was in truth a most unfortunate<br>
error. It wounds the popular feelings by a seeming indifference to the<br>
cause of liberty. And it seems to violate the form and spirit of the<br>
Constitution by making the executive magistrate the organ of the<br>
'disposition' 'the duty' and 'the interest' of the nation in relation to<br>
war and peace--subjects appropriated to other departments of&nbsp; the<br>
Government."<br>
<br>
"On one side," says Mr. Rives, in his "Life of Madison," "the people saw<br>
a power which had but lately carried war and desolation, fire and sword,<br>
through their own country, and, since the peace, had not ceased to act<br>
toward them in the old spirit of unkindness, jealousy, arrogance, and<br>
injustice; on the other an ally who had rendered them the most generous<br>
assistance in war, had evinced the most cordial dispositions for a<br>
liberal and mutually beneficial intercourse in peace, and was now set<br>
upon by an unholy league of the monarchical powers of Europe, to<br>
overwhelm and destroy her, for her desire to establish institutions<br>
congenial to those of America."<br>
<br>
The more sagacious opponents of the administration believed true policy<br>
as well as true honesty to demand rigid and pronounced adherence to the<br>
letter of the French treaty. They were convinced from the outset that<br>
France would vanquish her enemies, and that close alliance with her was<br>
the sure and the only sure way to coerce either Great Britain to justice<br>
or Spain to a reasonable attitude touching the navigation of the<br>
Mississippi; while by offending France, they argued, we should be forced<br>
to wrestle single-handed with England first, then with victorious<br>
France, meantime securing no concession whatever from Spain.<br>
<br>
This was a shrewd forecast of the actual event. The Federalists,<br>
destitute of idealism, proved to have been overawed by the prestige of<br>
England and to have underestimated the might which freedom would impart<br>
to the French people. After Napoleon's great campaign of 1796-97, Pitt<br>
seeks peace, which the French Directory feels able to decline. In 1802<br>
the Peace of Amiens is actually concluded, upon terms dictated by<br>
France. Had we been still in France's friendship, the two republics<br>
might have compelled England's abandonment of that course which evoked<br>
the war of 1812. As it was, ignored by England, to whom, as detailed<br>
below, we cringed in consenting to Jay's treaty, we were left to<br>
encounter the French navy alone, escaping open and serious war with<br>
France only by a readiness to negotiate which all but compromised our<br>
dignity. The Mississippi we had at last to open with money.<br>
<br>
The federalist leaning toward Great Britain probably did not, to so<br>
great an extent as was then alleged and widely believed, spring from<br>
monarchical feeling. It was due rather to old memories, as pleasant as<br>
they were tenacious, that would not be dissociated from England; to the<br>
individualistic tendencies of republicanism, alarming to many; and to<br>
conservative habits of political thinking, the dread of innovation and<br>
of theory. The returned Tories had indeed all become Federalists, which<br>
fact, with many others, lent to this attitude the appearance of<br>
deficient patriotism, of sycophancy toward our old foe and persecutor.<br>
<br>
Great Britain had refused to surrender the western posts according to<br>
the peace treaty of 1783, unjustly pleading in excuse the treatment of<br>
loyalists by our States. Not only the presence but the active influence<br>
of the garrisons at these posts encouraged Indian hostilities. England<br>
had also seized French goods in American (neutral) vessels, though in<br>
passage to the United States, and treated as belligerent all American<br>
ships plying between France and her West Indian colonies, on the ground<br>
that this commerce had been opened to them only by the pressure of war.<br>
The English naval officers were instructed to regard bread-stuffs as<br>
contraband if bound for France, even though owned by neutrals and in<br>
neutral ships; such cargoes, however, to be paid for by England, or<br>
released on bonds being given to land them elsewhere than in France. In<br>
this practice England followed France's example, except that she<br>
actually paid for the cargoes, while France only promised.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
[1795]<br>
<br>
Worst of all, Britain claimed and acted upon the right to press into her<br>
naval service British-born seamen found anywhere outside the territory<br>
of a foreign State, halting our ships on the high seas for this purpose,<br>
often leaving them half-manned, and sometimes recklessly and cruelly<br>
impressing native-born Americans--an outrageous policy which ended in<br>
the war of 1812. The ignorance and injustice of the English admiralty<br>
courts aggravated most of these abuses.<br>
<br>
Genet's proceedings, spoken of in the next chapter, which partly public<br>
sentiment, partly lack of army and navy, made it impossible for our<br>
Government to prevent, enraged Great Britain to the verge of war. After<br>
the British orders in council of November 6, 1793, intended to destroy<br>
all neutral commerce with the French colonies, and Congress's<br>
counter-stroke of an embargo the following March, war was positively<br>
imminent. The President resolved to send Jay to England as envoy<br>
extraordinary, to make one more effort for an understanding.<br>
<br>
The treaty negotiated by this gentleman, and ratified June 24,&nbsp;
1795<br>
(excepting Article XII., on the French West India trade), was doubtless<br>
the most favorable that could have been secured under the circumstances;<br>
yet it satisfied no one and was humiliating in the extreme. The western<br>
posts were indeed to be vacated by June 1, 1796, though without<br>
indemnity for the past, but a British right of search and impressment<br>
was implicitly recognized, the French West Indian trade not rendered<br>
secure, and arbitrary liberty accorded to Great Britain in defining<br>
contraband. Opposition to ratification was bitter and nearly universal.<br>
The friends of France were jubilant. Jay was burned in effigy,<br>
Washington himself attacked. The utmost that Hamilton in his powerful<br>
"Letters of Camillus" could show was that the treaty seemed preferable<br>
to war. Plainly we had then little to hope and much to fear from war<br>
with Great Britain, yet even vast numbers of Federalists denounced the<br>
pact as a base surrender to the nation's ancient tyrant, and wished an<br>
appeal to arms.<br>
<br>
Fisher Ames's eloquence decided the House for the treaty. An invalid,<br>
with but a span of life before him, he spoke as from the tomb. "There<br>
is, I believe," so ran his peroration, "no member who will not think his<br>
chance to be a witness of the consequences (should the treaty fail of<br>
ratification) greater than mine. If, however, the vote should pass to<br>
reject, and a spirit should rise, as it will, with the public disorders,<br>
to make confusion worse confounded, even I, slender and almost broken as<br>
my hold on life is, may outlive the Government and Constitution of my<br>
country!"<br>
<br>
It was the most delicate crisis of&nbsp; Washington's presidency, and no<br>
other American then alive, being in his place, could have passed through<br>
it successfully. After the fury gradually subsided, men for a long time<br>
acquiesced rather than believed in the step which had been taken. In the<br>
end the treaty proved solidly advantageous, rather through<br>
circumstances, however, than by its intrinsic excellence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
RELATIONS WITH THE FRENCH REPUBLIC<br>
<br>
[1793]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;At its beginning all Americans hailed the Revolution in France
with<br>
&nbsp;joy, but its terrible excesses, when they appeared, produced here
the<br>
&nbsp;same effect as in England, of alienating everyone conservatively<br>
&nbsp;inclined. This included the mass of the Federalist party. On the<br>
&nbsp;contrary, most of the Republicans, now more numerous, now less,<br>
&nbsp;actuated partly by true insight into the struggle, and partly by
the<br>
&nbsp;magic of the words "revolution" and "republic," favored the<br>
&nbsp;revolutionists with a devotion which even the Reign of Terror in
France<br>
&nbsp;scarcely shook. It was in consequence of this attitude on its
part that<br>
&nbsp;the party came to be dubbed "democratic-republican" instead of<br>
&nbsp;"republican," the compound title itself giving way after about
1810 to<br>
&nbsp;simple "democratic."<br>
<br>

possession of Henry Adams</span>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hostility to England, the memory of France's aid to us in our hour of<br>
need, the doctrine of "the rights of man," then so much in vogue, the<br>
known sympathies of Jefferson and Madison, who were already popular,<br>
and, alas, a mean wish to hamper the administration, all helped to swell<br>
the ranks of those who swung their hats for France. A far deeper motive<br>
with the more thoughtful was the belief that neutrality violated our<br>
treaty of 1778 with France, a conclusion at present beyond question.<br>
Politically our policy may have been wise, morally it was wrong.<br>
<br>
The administration, at least its honored head, was doubtless innocent of<br>
any intentional injustice; and it could certainly urge a great deal in<br>
justification of its course. The form and the aims of the French<br>
Government had changed since the treaty originated, involving a state of<br>
things which that instrument had not contemplated.&nbsp; France herself<br>
defied international law and compact, revolutionizing and incorporating<br>
Holland and Geneva, and assaulting our commerce. And war with England<br>
then threatened our ruin. Yet the pleading of these considerations in<br>
that so trying hour, even had they been wholly pertinent, could not but<br>
seem to Frenchmen treason to the cause of liberty. As to many<br>
Federalists, trucklers to England, such a charge would have been true.<br>
<br>
France was not slow to reciprocate in the matter of grievances. In fact,<br>
so early as May, 1793, before the proclamation of neutrality could have<br>
been heard of in that country, orders had been issued there, wholly<br>
repugnant to the treaty (which had ordained that neutral ships could<br>
carry what goods they pleased--free ships, free goods), to capture and<br>
condemn English merchandise on American vessels. Provisions owned by<br>
Americans and en route to England were also to be forfeited as<br>
contraband. Even the most reasonable French officials seemed bent on<br>
treating our country as a dependency of France.<br>
<br>
We see this in the actions of Genet, the first envoy to America from the<br>
French constitutional monarchy, accredited hither by a ministry of<br>
high-minded Republicans while Louis XVI. still sat upon his throne.<br>
Genet arrived in Charleston in 1793, before our neutrality had been<br>
proclaimed. Immediately, before presenting his credentials to our<br>
Government, he set about fitting out privateers, manning them with<br>
Americans, and sending them to prey upon British ships, some of which<br>
they captured in American waters. All this was in utter derogation of<br>
the treaty, which only guaranteed shelter to bona fide French vessels.<br>
Under a law of the French National Convention, Genet assumed to erect<br>
the French consulates in this country into so many admiralty courts for<br>
the trial of British prizes. We could not have allowed this without<br>
decidedly violating international law at least in spirit. He also<br>
devised and partly arranged expeditions of Americans, to start, one from<br>
Georgia to invade Florida, another from Kentucky to capture New Orleans,<br>
both as means of weakening Spain, which up to this time and for several<br>
years later was France's foe.<br>
<br>
[1795]<br>
<br>
But Genet's worst gall came out in his conduct toward Washington. Him he<br>
insulted, challenging his motives and his authority for his acts and<br>
threatening to appeal from him to the people. He tried to bully and<br>
browbeat the whole cabinet as if they had been so many boys. So<br>
ludicrous did he make himself by such useless bluster, that his friends,<br>
at first numerous and many of them influential, gave him the cold<br>
shoulder, and the ardor for France greatly cooled. At length Washington<br>
effected his removal, the more easily, it would seem, as he was not<br>
radical enough for the Jacobins, who had now succeeded to the helm in<br>
France. The officious Frenchman did not return to his own country, but<br>
settled down in New York, marrying a daughter of Governor Clinton. He<br>
was succeeded by Adet.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">From a painting by Ezra Ames.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Upon learning that the United States had ratified Jay's treaty, France<br>
went insane with rage. A declaration of war by us could not have angered<br>
her more. Adet was called home and the alliance with America declared at<br>
an end. Barras dismissed Mr. Monroe, our minister, in a contemptuous<br>
speech, and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, sent as Monroe's successor, was<br>
not only not received but ordered from the land. New and worse decrees<br>
went forth against American commerce. Our ships were confiscated for<br>
carrying English goods though not contraband. Arbitrary and unheard-of<br>
tests of neutrality were trumped up, wholly contrary to the treaty,<br>
which indeed was now denounced. American sailors found serving, though<br>
compelled, on British armed vessels, were to be condemned as pirates.<br>
<br>
[1797]<br>
<br>
These brutal measures, coupled with Napoleon's increasing power, begot<br>
in America the belief, even among Republicans, that France's struggle<br>
was no longer for liberty but for conquest. The insolence of the French<br>
Government waxed insufferable. President Adams, to a special session of<br>
the Vth Congress, on May 19, 1797, announced the insult to the nation in<br>
the person of Pinckney, and urged preparation for war. A goodly loan, a<br>
direct tax, and a provisional army, Washington again leader, were<br>
readily voted. Our Navy Department was created at this time. The navy<br>
was increased, and several captures were made of French vessels guilty<br>
of outrage. Adams, however, to make a last overture for peace,<br>
despatched John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry to the aid of Pinckney, the<br>
three to knock once more at France's doors for a becoming admission. In<br>
vain. The only effect was a new chapter of French mendacity and<br>
insolence, furthering America's wish and preparations for war.<br>
Napoleon's recent Italian victories, terrifying Europe, had puffed up<br>
France with pride. Talleyrand assumed to arraign us as criminals, and<br>
what was worse, pressed us, through his agents, to buy his country's<br>
forgiveness with gold. "You must pay money," our envoys were told, and<br>
"a good deal of it, too."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 452px; height: 566px;" alt="" src="images/253Pic.jpg"><br>
John Marshall.<br>
<br>
<br>
All this was duly made known at Philadelphia, and the President assured<br>
Congress that no terms were obtainable from France "compatible with the<br>
safety, honor, and general interest of the nation." The opposition<br>
thought this an exaggeration, and called for the despatches, expecting<br>
refusal or abridgment. The President sent every word.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 457px; height: 533px;" alt="" src="images/254Pic.jpg"><br>

<br>
<br>
Confusion seized the Republicans. Federalists were again in the<br>
ascendant, the VIth Congress being much more strongly federalist than<br>
the Vth. For once proud, reserved John Adams was popular, and<br>
anti-French feeling irresistible. "Millions for defence but not a cent<br>
for tribute," echoed through the land. Hosts of Republicans went over to<br>
the administration side. Patriotism became a passion. Each night at the<br>
theatre rose a universal call for the "President's March" [Footnote: The<br>
music was that of our "Hail Columbia."] and "Yankee Doodle," the<br>
audience rising, cheering, swinging hats and canes, and roaring<br>
"encore." The black cockade, American, on all hands supplanted the<br>
tricolor cockade worn by the "Gallomaniacs;" and bands of "Associated<br>
Youth," organizing in every town and city, deluged the President with<br>
patriotic addresses.<br>
<br>
Seeing that we could not be bullied and that the friends of France here<br>
were Americans first; ashamed, on their publication, of the indignities<br>
which he had offered our envoys, and after all not wishing war with what<br>
he saw to be potentially another naval power like England, the sly<br>
Talleyrand neatly receded from his arrogant demands, and expressed a<br>
desire to negotiate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
THE DECLINE OF THE FEDERALIST PARTY<br>
<br>
[1797]<br>
<br>
The heat of the nation's wrath evoked by this conflict with France<br>
betrayed the Federalists in Congress into some pieces of tyrannical<br>
legislation. These were especially directed against refugees from<br>
France, lest they should attempt to reenact here the bloody drama just<br>
played out there. Combinations were alleged, without proof, to exist<br>
between American and French democrats, dangerous to the stability of<br>
this Government.<br>
<br>
A new naturalization act was passed, requiring of an immigrant, as<br>
prerequisite to citizenship, fourteen years of residence instead of the<br>
five heretofore sufficient. Next came three alien acts, empowering the<br>
President, at his discretion, without trial or even a statement of his<br>
reasons, to banish foreigners from the land; any who should return<br>
unbidden being liable to imprisonment for three years, and cut off from<br>
the possibility of citizenship forever. A "sedition act" followed, to<br>
fine in the sum of $5,000 each and to imprison for five years any<br>
persons stirring up sedition, combining to oppose governmental measures,<br>
resisting United States law, or putting forth "any false, scandalous, or<br>
malicious writings" against Congress, the President, or the Government.<br>
<br>
To President Adams's credit, he was no abettor of these hateful decrees,<br>
and did little to enforce them. The sedition law, however, did not rest<br>
with him for execution, and was applied right and left. Evidently its<br>
champions were swayed largely by political motives. Matthew Lyon, a<br>
fiery Republican member of Congress from Vermont, had, in an address to<br>
his constituents, charged the President with avarice and with "thirst<br>
for ridiculous pomp and foolish adulation," He was convicted of<br>
sedition, fined $1,000, and sentenced to four months in prison. This<br>
impoverished him, as well as took him from his place in Congress for<br>
most of a session. Adams refused pardon, but in 1840 Congress paid back<br>
the fine to Lyon's heirs.<br>
<br>
It is now admitted that these measures were unconstitutional, as<br>
invading freedom of speech and of the press, and assigning to the<br>
Federal Judiciary a common-law jurisdiction in criminal matters. But<br>
they were also highly unwise, subjecting the Federalist Party to the<br>
odium of fearing free speech, of declining a discussion of its policy,<br>
and of hating foreigners. The least opposition to the party in power, or<br>
criticism of its official chiefs, became criminal, under the head of<br>
"opposing" the Government. A joke or a caricature might send its author<br>
to jail as "seditious." It was surely a travesty upon liberty when a man<br>
could be arrested for expressing the wish, as a salute was fired, that<br>
the wadding might hit John Adams behind. Even libels upon government, if<br>
it is to be genuinely free, must be ignored--a principle now acted upon<br>
by all constitutional States.<br>
<br>
But the Federalists were blind to considerations like these. As Schouler<br>
well remarks: "A sort of photophobia afflicted statesmen, who, allowing<br>
little for the good sense and spirit of Americans, or our geographical<br>
disconnection with France, were crazed with the fear that this Union<br>
might be, like Venice, made over to some European potentate, or chained<br>
in the same galley with Switzerland or Holland, to do the Directory's<br>
bidding. That, besides this unfounded fear, operated the desire of<br>
ultra-Federalists to take revenge upon those presses which had assailed<br>
the British treaty and other pet measures, and abused Federal leaders;<br>
and the determination to entrench themselves in authority by forcibly<br>
disbanding an opposition party which attracted a readier support at the<br>
polls from the oppressed of other countries, no candid writer can at<br>
this day question."<br>
<br>
[1798]<br>
<br>
It was next the turn of the Republicans to blunder. In November, 1798,<br>
the Kentucky Legislature passed a series of resolutions, drawn up by<br>
John Breckenridge upon a sketch by Jefferson, in effect declaring the<br>
alien and sedition acts not law, but altogether void and of no force. In<br>
December the Virginia Legislature put forth a similar series by Madison,<br>
milder in tone and more cautiously expressed, denouncing those acts as<br>
"palpable and alarming infractions of the Constitution." A year after<br>
their first utterance, the Kentucky law-makers further "resolved that<br>
the several States who formed (the Constitution), being sovereign and<br>
independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction;<br>
and that a nullification by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized<br>
acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy."<br>
Virginia again declared it a State's right "to interpose" in such cases.<br>
<br>
These resolutions were intended to stir reflection and influence<br>
opinion, and, if&nbsp; possible, elicit a concurrent request to
Congress from<br>
the various States to repeal the obnoxious acts. They do not hint at the<br>
use of force. Their execration of the hated laws is none too strong, and<br>
their argument as a whole is masterly and unanswerable. But at least<br>
those of Kentucky suggest, if they do not contain, a doctrine respecting<br>
the Constitution which is untenable and baneful, in kernel the same that<br>
threatened secession in Jackson's time and brought it in Buchanan's. The<br>
State, as such, is not a party to the Constitution. Still less is the<br>
Legislature. Nor is either, but the Supreme Court, the judge whether in<br>
any case the fundamental law has been infringed.<br>
<br>
Procuring the resolutions, however, proved a crafty political move. The<br>
enormity of the despicable acts was advertised as never before, while<br>
the endorsement of them by federalist legislators went upon record.<br>
Petitions for repeal came in so numerous and numerously signed that the<br>
VIth Congress could not but raise a committee to consider such action.<br>
It reported adversely, and the report was accepted, the majority in the<br>
House, fifty-two to forty-eight, trying contemptuously to cough down<br>
every speaker lifting his voice on the opposite side.<br>
<br>
[1799]<br>
<br>
This sullen obstinacy in favor of a miserable experiment sealed the doom<br>
of Federalism. In vain did the party orators plead that liberty of<br>
speech and the press is not license, but only the right to utter "the<br>
truth," that hence this liberty was not abridged by the acts in<br>
question, and that aliens had no constitutional rights, but enjoyed the<br>
privileges of the land only by favor. The fact remained, more and more<br>
appreciated by ordinary people, that a land ruled by such maxims could<br>
never be free.<br>
<br>
So a deep distrust of Federalism sprung up, as out of sympathy with<br>
popular government. It was furthered by the attachment of prominent<br>
Federalists to England. Several of them are on record as ready to<br>
involve the United States in an expedition planned by one Miranda, to<br>
conquer Spanish America in aid of Great Britain, Spain and ourselves<br>
being perfectly at peace. The federalist chieftains were too proud,<br>
ignoring too much the common voter. They often expressed doubt, too, as<br>
to the permanence of popular institutions. Federalism had too close<br>
affinity with Puritanism to suit many outside New England. And<br>
then--deadly to the party even had nothing else concurred--there was a<br>
quarrel among its leaders. Hamilton, the Essex Junto (Pickering, Cabot,<br>
Quincy, Otis), and their supporters were set against Adams and his<br>
friends. This rivalry of long standing was brought to a head by Adams's<br>
noble and self-sacrificing independence in accepting France's overtures<br>
for peace, when Hamilton, Pickering, King, and all the rest, out of<br>
private or party interest rather than patriotism, wished war.<br>
<br>
[1800]<br>
<br>
Toward 1800, Democracy bade fair soon to come into power, but the<br>
Federalists learned no wisdom. Rather were they henceforth more factious<br>
than ever, opposing Jefferson and Madison even when they acted on purely<br>
federalist principles. Tooth and nail they fought against the<br>
acquisition of Louisiana, the War of 1812, and the protective tariff of<br>
1816, which was carried by Republicans. A worse spirit still was shown<br>
in their disunion scheme of 1804, after the purchase of Louisiana, and<br>
in the Hartford Convention of 1814. Federalism had further lost ground<br>
by its mean and revolutionary devices on resigning power in 1801, first<br>
to make Burr President instead of Jefferson, and, failing in this, to<br>
use its expiring authority in creating needless offices for its clients.<br>
<br>
In consequence of such ill-advised steps, federalist strength waned<br>
apace. In 1804 Connecticut, Delaware, and Maryland alone chose<br>
federalist electors, the last only two such. In 1808 these were joined<br>
by the remaining New England States, North Carolina also casting three<br>
federalist votes. In 1812, indeed, Clinton received eighty-nine votes to<br>
Madison's one hundred and twenty-eight; but in 1816 again only<br>
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware were federalist. In 1820 not a<br>
State had a federalist majority. State elections in Maryland, North<br>
Carolina, Delaware, and Connecticut commonly went federalist till 1820,<br>
and in Massachusetts till 1823, when the Republicans swept this<br>
commonwealth too, Essex County and all.<br>
<br>
Yet Federalism did not die without fixing its stamp indelibly upon our<br>
institutions. Not to mention the Whig and the modern Republican Parties,<br>
close reproductions of it, or the public credit, its child, methods of<br>
administration passed with little change from Adams to Jefferson and his<br>
successors, and federalist principles modified the entire temper, and<br>
directed in no small degree the action, of the Democratic Party while in<br>
power. The nation was exalted more, state rights subordinated, and the<br>
Constitution construed ever more broadly. Thus there was silently and<br>
gradually imparted to our governmental fabric a consistency and a<br>
solidity which were of incalculable worth against storms to come.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
THE WEST<br>
<br>
[1787]<br>
<br>
A simple resolution of the Continental Congress in 1780 has proved of<br>
the highest consequence for the subsequent development of our country.<br>
It declared that all territorial land should be national domain, to be<br>
disposed of for the common benefit of the States, with the high<br>
privilege of itself growing into States coequal with the old Thirteen.<br>
The treaty of 1783 carried this domain north to the Lakes, west to the<br>
Mississippi. The Ohio divided it into a northwestern and a southwestern<br>
part. The land to the west of themselves Virginia and North Carolina<br>
claimed, and it became Kentucky and Tennessee, respectively, erected<br>
into statehood, the one June 1, 1792, the other June 1, 1796, these<br>
being the fifteenth and sixteenth States in order. Vermont, admitted in<br>
1791, was the fourteenth. Virginia never released Kentucky till it<br>
became a State. The Tennessee country, ceded to the United States by<br>
North Carolina in 1784, the cession revoked and afterward repeated, had<br>
already, under the name of Frankland, enjoyed for some time a separate<br>
administration. The nucleus of Kentucky civilization was on the northern<br>
or Ohio River border, that of Tennessee in the Cumberland Valley about<br>
Nashville; but by 1800 the borders of these two oases had joined.<br>
<br>
United States land has since broadened westward to the Pacific, over the<br>
infinite areas which in 1800 belonged to Spain. From an early period<br>
there have been, as now, unorganized territory and also partially<br>
organized and fully organized territories, the last being inchoate<br>
States, ready to be admitted to full membership in the Union when<br>
sufficiently populous, on condition of framing each for itself a<br>
republican constitution.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 457px; height: 533px;" alt="" src="images/268Pic.jpg"><br>
General Arthur St. Clair.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1788]<br>
<br>
The great ordinance of 1787, re-enacted by the First Congress, forever<br>
sealing the same to civil and religious liberty, opened the Northwest<br>
for immediate colonization, twenty thousand people settling there in the<br>
next two years. The territory was organized and General St. Clair made<br>
governor. In 1788 Marietta was founded, named from Marie Antoinette,<br>
also Columbia near the mouth of the Little Miami. In the same year<br>
Losantiville, subsequently called Fort Washington, and now Cincinnati,<br>
was laid out, the first houses having gone up in 1780. Louisville,<br>
settled so early as 1773, contained in 1784 over one hundred houses.<br>
Emigrants in hundreds and thousands yearly poured over the mountains and<br>
down the Ohio. By the census of 1790 there were 4,280 whites northwest<br>
of this river, 1,000 at Vincennes, 1,000 on the lands of the Ohio<br>
Company, 1,300 on Symmes's purchase between the Great and the Little<br>
Miami, Cincinnati being part of this purchase. In 1800 these numbers had<br>
much increased. The settlements which had Pittsburgh for a nucleus had<br>
also greatly extended, reaching the Ohio. Northern and Central<br>
Pennsylvania west of the Susquehanna Valley was yet a wilderness. St.<br>
Louis, in Spanish hands, but to become French next year, had been<br>
founded, and opposite it were the beginnings of what is now Alton, Ill.<br>
<br>
[1790]<br>
<br>
The centre of United States population in 1790 was twenty-three miles<br>
east of Baltimore. It has since moved westward, not far from the<br>
thirty-ninth parallel, never more than sixteen miles north of it, or<br>
three to the south. In 1800 it was eighteen miles west of Baltimore; in<br>
1810 it was forty-three miles northwest by west of Washington; in 1820,<br>
sixteen miles north of Woodstock, Va.; in 1830, nineteen miles<br>
west-southwest of Moorfield, W. Va.; in 1840, sixteen miles south of<br>
Clarksburg, same State; in 1850, twenty-three miles southeast of<br>
Parkersburg, same State; in 1860, twenty miles south of Chillicothe, 0.;<br>
in 1870, forty-eight miles east by north of Cincinnati; in 1880, eight<br>
miles west by south of that city; in 1890, twenty miles east of<br>
Columbus, Ind., west by south of Greensburg. It has never since been so<br>
far north as in 1790, and it has described a total westward movement of<br>
four hundred and fifty-seven miles.<br>
<br>
The land system of the United States was at first a bad one, intended<br>
to secure immediate revenue from the sale of immense pieces at auction,<br>
on long credit, at very few points, the land to find its way into the<br>
hands of actual settlers only through mercenary speculators. The honest<br>
pioneer was therefore at the mercy of these land-sharks, greedy and<br>
unpatriotic in the extreme.<br>
<br>
The western movement aroused the Indians, of whom there were, in 1790,<br>
from 20,000 to 40,000 north of the Ohio. The idea of amalgamating or<br>
even civilizing these people had long been practically given up.<br>
Settlers agreed in denouncing them as treacherous, intractable,<br>
bloodthirsty, and faithless. So incessant and terrific were their<br>
onslaughts, the Ohio Valley had come to be known as "the dark and bloody<br>
ground." The British, still occupying the western posts, used their<br>
influence to keep up and intensify Indian hostility to the United States<br>
settlers and Government.<br>
<br>
In September, 1790, Governor St. Clair sent Harmar against the Indians<br>
on the Miami and Maumee. He had about fifteen hundred men, two-thirds of<br>
them militia. The expedition was ill-managed from the first, and, after<br>
advancing as far as the present Fort Wayne, came back with great loss to<br>
itself, having exasperated rather than injured the red men. Harmar,<br>
chagrined, soon resigned.<br>
<br>
The Indians south of the Ohio were perhaps twice as numerous as those<br>
north, and partly civilized. The Chickasaws and Choctaws, nearest the<br>
Mississippi, gave little trouble. Not so the Cherokees and Creeks, whose<br>
seats were nearer the whites. The Creeks claimed parts of Tennessee,<br>
Georgia, and the Carolinas, justified herein by acts of the Continental<br>
Congress. However, the whites invaded this territory, provoking a fierce<br>
war, wherein the Cherokees allied themselves with the Creeks of Alabama<br>
and Georgia. This brave tribe had border troubles of its own with<br>
Georgia. These various hordes of savages, having the Florida Spaniards<br>
to back them with counsel, arms, and ammunition, were a formidable foe,<br>
which might have annihilated Georgia but for aid from the general<br>
Government. McGillivray, the half-breed chief of the Creeks, was enticed<br>
to New York, where the kindness of Washington and the evident desire of<br>
Congress to deal with his people fairly, resulted in a treaty, August<br>
13, 1790, which secured peace to the Southwest for a long time.<br>
<br>
[1791]<br>
<br>
Touching the northwestern redskins, Harmar's defeat had convinced<br>
Washington that mild measures were not yet the thing. A larger force was<br>
fitted out against them under St. Clair in person, whom, as an old<br>
Revolutionary comrade, Washington still trusted. General Butler was<br>
second in command. The two thousand regulars and one thousand militia<br>
rendezvoused at Cincinnati in the autumn of 1791. Part object of the<br>
expedition was to build a military road, with forts at intervals, all<br>
the way to the upper Wabash. Progress was therefore slow.<br>
<br>
A fort was constructed on the present site of Hamilton, 0.; then one to<br>
the northwest, near Greenville, 0., close to the present Indiana line.<br>
From here the army pressed northwesterly still farther.<br>
<br>
St. Clair was heroic, but incompetent through age and the gout. Some of<br>
his militia deserted. Chills and fever shook the remainder of his too<br>
slender host. His orders were not well obeyed. On November 9th,<br>
encamping by a small branch of the Wabash, St. Clair's force was most<br>
vehemently attacked by Indians, under the redoubtable Joseph Brant or<br>
Thayendanegea--famed for his bloody exploits against us during the<br>
Revolution--and well-nigh annihilated. Five high officers, including<br>
Butler, were killed, and as many more sank from wounds. Cannons, guns,<br>
accoutrements, in fact the whole equipment of the army, were lost. After<br>
a four hours' fight St. Clair, sick but brave as a tiger, horse after<br>
horse shot beneath him, part of the time carried in a litter, his gray<br>
locks streaming in the breeze, put himself at the head of the five<br>
hundred who remained unscathed, and hewed his way through walls of<br>
savages to the rear. Six o'clock that night found the survivors back at<br>
Greenville, twenty-nine miles from the scene of carnage. Had the Indians<br>
pursued instead of stopping to mutilate the slain, every soul must have<br>
perished.<br>
<br>
<br>

Joseph Brant or Thayendanegea.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1793]<br>
<br>
The announcement of this disaster called forth in the East a universal<br>
howl of rage at the unfortunate commander. Even Washington went beside<br>
himself: "To suffer that army to be cut to pieces, hacked, butchered,<br>
tomahawked, by a surprise--the very thing I guarded him against! O God!<br>
O God, he is worse than a murderer! How can he answer it to his country?<br>
The blood of the slain is upon him, the curse of widows and orphans, the<br>
curse of Heaven." St. Clair came East to explain. Hobbling into<br>
Washington's presence, he grasped his hand in both his own and sobbed<br>
aloud. He was continued as governor, but had to resign his<br>
major-generalship, which passed to Anthony Wayne.<br>
<br>
Wayne was every inch a warrior. Cautiously advancing over the road St.<br>
Clair's fugitives had reddened with their blood, he reached Fort<br>
Jefferson, at Greenville, in June, 1793. Next year he advanced to the<br>
junction of the Au Glaize with the Maumee. The Indians fleeing, he<br>
pursued to the foot of the Maumee Rapids, where he encountered them<br>
encamped by a fort which the English, defying the treaty, still held,<br>
fifty miles inside our lines. Wayne, agreeably to Washington's policy,<br>
tried to treat. Failing, he attacked, routed the enemy, and mercilessly<br>
ravaged the country, burning crops and villages. Building Fort Wayne as<br>
an advanced post, he came back and made his headquarters at Fort<br>
Jefferson. The Indians' spirit and opposition were at last broken. Their<br>
delegates flocked to Wayne, suing for peace. Captives were surrendered.<br>
The whole Ohio Territory now lay open to peaceful occupation, and<br>
emigrants crowded northward from the Ohio in great companies.<br>
<br>
[1794]<br>
<br>
The pioneer bought land wherever he found a vacant spot that pleased<br>
him, building his hut, breaking up any open land for crops, and as<br>
rapidly as possible clearing for more. His white neighbors, if any were<br>
near, lent their assistance in this work. His rough dwelling of logs,<br>
with one room, floored with puncheon, caulked with mud, and covered with<br>
bark or thatch, however uncomfortable from our point of view, made him a<br>
habitable home. When this primitive mansion was no longer sufficient, he<br>
was usually able to rear another out of hewn logs, with glass windows<br>
and a chimney. Then he felt himself an aristocrat, and who will deny<br>
that he was so? A large family grew up around him, neighbors moved in,<br>
the forest disappeared, the savages and wild beasts that at first<br>
harassed him slunk away, while the fruitful soil, with such exchanges<br>
and mail privileges as were speedily possible, yielded him all the<br>
necessaries and many of the comforts of life.<br>
<br>
[1800]<br>
<br>
So rapid was the increase of population henceforth, that Congress, in<br>
1800, divided the territory, the line running north from the junction of<br>
the Kentucky with the Ohio. All west of this was to be known as the<br>
Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison its governor, and a<br>
territorial legislature to follow so soon as a majority of the<br>
inhabitants should desire.<br>
<br>
On February 19, 1803, Ohio became a State. Mainly through Governor<br>
Harrison's exertions a better system of marketing public land was begun,<br>
in healthy contrast with the old. It allowed four land-offices in Ohio<br>
and Indiana. Lands once offered at auction and not sold could be<br>
pre-empted directly by private individuals on easy terms. Actual<br>
settlement and cultivation were thus furthered, speculation curbed, and<br>
the government revenues vastly increased.<br>

<br>
<br>
[1802]<br>
<br>
We have spoken mostly of the Northwest. The present States of Alabama<br>
and Mississippi north of 31 degrees, except a narrow strip at the<br>
extreme north owned by South Carolina, were claimed by Georgia, but the<br>
part of this territory south of 32 degrees 30 minutes the United States<br>
also claimed, as having before the Revolution been separated from<br>
Georgia by the king and joined to West Florida, so that it, like the<br>
Northwest, passed to the United States at the treaty of 1783. This<br>
section was organized in 1798 as the Mississippi Territory. In 1802<br>
Georgia relinquished all claim to the northern part as well, which<br>
Congress added to the Mississippi Territory. At this date there were<br>
settlements along the Mississippi bluffs below the Yazoo bottom.<br>

<br>
CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
SOCIAL CULTURE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY<br>
<br>
[1800]<br>
<br>
In 1800 the population of our land was 5,305,482, of whom 896,849 were<br>
slaves. New York City had 60,489; Philadelphia, 40,000; Boston, 24,937;<br>
Baltimore, 23,971; Charleston, 18,712; Providence, 7,614; Washington,<br>
3,210. The population of Vermont, Northern and Western New York, and the<br>
Susquehanna Valley of Pennsylvania had grown considerably more dense<br>
since 1790. The social life, ideas, and habits of the rural districts<br>
had not altered much from those prevalent in colonial days, but in the<br>
more favored centres great improvements, or, at any rate, changes, might<br>
have been marked.<br>
<br>
Even far in the country framed buildings were now the most common, the<br>
raising of one being a great event. The village school gave a half<br>
holiday. Every able-bodied man and boy from the whole country-side<br>
received an invitation--all being needed to "heave up," at the boss<br>
carpenter's pompous word of command, the ponderous timbers seemingly<br>
meant to last forever. A feast followed, with contests of strength and<br>
agility worthy of description on Homer's page.<br>
<br>
Skating was not yet a frequent pastime, nor dancing, save in cities and<br>
large towns. Balls every pious New Englander abhorred as sinful. The<br>
theatre was similarly tabooed--in Massachusetts, so late as 1784, by<br>
law. New York and Philadelphia frowned upon it then, though jolly<br>
Baltimore already gave it patrons enough. When, in 1793, yellow fever<br>
desolated Philadelphia, one theory ascribed the affection to the<br>
admission of the theatre. In other cities passion for the theatre was<br>
growing, and even Massachusetts tolerated it by an act passed in 1793.<br>
President Washington, while in New York, oftener than many thought<br>
proper, attended the old, sorrily furnished play-house in John Street,<br>
the only one which the city could then boast. John Adams also went now<br>
and again. Both were squinted at through opera-glasses, which were just<br>
coming into use and thought by the crowd to be infinitely ridiculous.<br>
Good hours were kept, as the play began at five.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 670px; height: 389px;" alt="" src="images/285Pic.jpg"><br>
Fulton's First Experiment with Paddle-wheels.<br>
<br>
<br>
All sorts of shows, games, and sports which the country could afford or<br>
devise were immensely popular, the most so, and the roughest, in the<br>
South. Horse-racing, cock-fighting, shooting matches, at all which<br>
betting was high, were there fashionable, as well as most brutal<br>
man-fights, in which ears were bitten off and eyes gouged out. President<br>
Thomas Jefferson was exceedingly fond of menageries and circuses, his<br>
diary abounding in such entries as: "pd for seeing a lion 21 months old<br>
11-1/2 d.;" "pd seeing a small seal .125 ;" "pd seeing elephant .5;" "pd<br>
seeing elk .75 ;" "pd seeing Caleb Phillips a dwarf .25;" "pd seeing a<br>
painting .25."<br>
<br>
Lotteries were universal, and put to uses which now seem excessively<br>
queer. Whenever a bridge or a public edifice, as a schoolhouse, was to<br>
be built, a street paved or a road repaired, the money was furnished<br>
through a lottery. In the same way manufacturing companies were started,<br>
churches aided, college treasuries replenished. It was with money<br>
collected through a lottery that Massachusetts first encouraged cotton<br>
spinning; that the City Hall of New York was enlarged, the Court House<br>
at Elizabeth rebuilt, the Harvard University library increased, and many<br>
pretentious buildings put up at the Federal City. [Footnote: McMaster's<br>
United States, 588.] This was but a single form of the sporting mania.<br>
The public stocks, as well as the paper of the numerous canals,<br>
turnpikes, and manufacturing corporations now springing up, were gambled<br>
in a way which would almost shock Wall Street today.<br>
<br>

Departure of the Clermont on her First Voyage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anthracite coal had been discovered and was just beginning to be mined,<br>
but on account of the plentifulness of wood was not for a long time<br>
largely used. The first idea of steam navigation was embodied in an<br>
English patent taken out by Jonathan Hulls in 1736. The initial<br>
experiment of the kind in this country was by William Henry, on the<br>
Conestoga River, Pennsylvania, in 1763. John Fitch navigated the<br>
Delaware steam-wise in 1783-84. In 1790 one of Fitch's steam<br>
paddle-boats made regular trips between Philadelphia and Trenton for<br>
four months. In 1785-86 Oliver Evans experimented in this direction, as<br>
did Rumsey, in Virginia, in 1787. One Morey ran a stern-wheeler of his<br>
own make from Hartford to New York in 1794. Chancellor Livingston built<br>
a steamer on the Hudson in 1797. It was only in 1807 that Fulton<br>
finished his "Clermont" and made a passage up the Hudson to Albany from<br>
New York. It took thirty-three hours, and was the earliest thoroughly<br>
successful steam navigation on record. He subsequently built the<br>
"Orleans" at Pittsburgh. It was completed and made the voyage to New<br>
Orleans in 1811. No steamboat ruffled the waters of Lake Ontario till<br>
1816. The pioneer steam craft on Lake Erie was launched at Black Rock,<br>
May 28, 1818. It is recorded as wonderful that in less than two hours it<br>
had gotten fifteen miles from shore.<br>

<br>
<br>
At the North the muster or general training was, for secular<br>
entertainment, the day of days, when the local regiment came out to<br>
reveal and to perfect its skill in the manual and in the evolutions of<br>
the line. Side-shows and a general good time constituted for the crowds<br>
its chief interest. Cider, cakes, pop-corn, and candy drained boys'<br>
pockets of pennies, those who could afford the fun going in to see the<br>
one-legged revolutionary soldier with his dancing bear, the tattooed<br>
man, the ventriloquist, or the then "greatest show on earth." College<br>
commencements, too, at that time usually had all these festive<br>
accompaniments, and many a boy debated whether to spend his scant change<br>
here or at the muster. In New England, Christmas was not observed; it<br>
was hardly known, in fact, Thanksgiving taking its place, proclaimed<br>
with the utmost formality by the Governor some weeks in advance.<br>
<br>
Intemperance was still terribly common; worst in the newer sections of<br>
the country. There is extant a message of William Henry Harrison, while<br>
Governor of Indiana Territory, to his legislature, against this evil,<br>
urging better surveillance of public-houses. "The progress of<br>
intemperance among us," it runs, "outstrips all calculation, and the<br>
consequences of its becoming general I shudder to unfold. Poverty and<br>
domestic embarrassment and distress are the present effects, and<br>
prostration of morals and change of government must inevitably follow.<br>
The virtue of the citizens is the only support of a Republican<br>
Government. Destroy this and the country will become a prey to the first<br>
daring and ambitious chief which it shall produce."<br>

<br>
To counteract this and other vices, which were justly viewed as largely<br>
the results of ignorance, philanthropic people were at this period<br>
establishing Sunday-schools, following the example of Robert Raikes, who<br>
began the movement at Gloucester, England, in 1781. They had been<br>
already introduced in New England, but were now making their way in<br>
Philadelphia and elsewhere. The first Methodist bishop, Asbury,<br>
zealously furthered them. They had, to begin with, no distinctive<br>
religious character, and churches even looked upon them with disfavor;<br>
but their numbers increased and their value became more apparent until<br>
the institution was adopted by all denominations.<br>
<br>
Before 1800 the new United States coinage, with nearly the same pieces<br>
as now, had begun to circulate, but had had little success at that date<br>
in driving out the old foreign coins of colonial times. Especially were<br>
there still seen Spanish dollars, halves, quarters, fifths or<br>
pistareens, and eighths--the last being the Spanish "real," "ryall," or<br>
"royall," worth twelve and a half cents--and sixteenths or half-reals,<br>
worth six and one-quarter cents each. Many of these pieces were sadly<br>
worn, passing at their face value only when the legend could be made<br>
out. Sometimes they were heated to aid in this. Many were so worn that a<br>
pistareen would bring only a Yankee shilling, sixteen and two-thirds<br>
cents; the half-pistareen, only eight cents; the real, ten; the<br>
half-real, five.<br>

<br>
The denominations of the colonial money of account were also still in<br>
daily use, and, indeed, might be heard so late as the Civil War. The<br>
"real," twelve and one-half cents, was in New York a shilling, being<br>
one-twentieth of the pound once prevalent in the New York colony. In New<br>
England it was a "nine-pence," constituting nearly nine-twelfths, or<br>
nine of the twelve pence of an old New England shilling of sixteen and<br>
two-thirds cents. Twenty such shillings had been required for the New<br>
England pound, which was so much more valuable than the pound of the New<br>
York colony. But neither one or any colonial pound was the equivalent of<br>
the pound sterling.<br>

In the middle colonies, including Pennsylvania, the pound had possessed<br>
still a different value, the Spanish dollar, in which the Continental<br>
Congress kept its accounts, there equalling ninety pence. This is why<br>
those accounts stand in dollars and ninetieths, a notation so puzzling<br>
to many. A "real" would here be about one-eleventh of ninety pence,<br>
hence called the "eleven-penny-piece," shortened into "levy." Dividing<br>
a levy by two would give five (and a fraction); hence the term<br>
"five-penny-piece," "fippenny," or "fip," for the half-real or six and<br>
one-quarter cent piece. There are doubtless yet people in Virginia and<br>
Maryland who never say "twenty-five cents," but instead, "two levies and<br>
a fip."<br>

General intelligence had improved, partly from the greater number,<br>
better quality, and quicker and fuller distribution of newspapers.<br>
Correspondents were numerous. Intelligent persons visiting at a distance<br>
from home were wont to write long letters to their local newspapers,<br>
containing all the items of interest which they could scrape together.<br>
Papers sprung up at every considerable hamlet. Even the Ohio Valley did<br>
not lack. Perhaps four and a half million copies a year were issued in<br>
the whole country by 1800. They were admitted now--not so, however,<br>
under the original postal law--as a regular part of the mails, and thus<br>
found their way to nearly all homes. The news which they brought was<br>
often old news, of course, post riders requiring twenty-nine and<br>
one-half hours between Philadelphia and either New York or Baltimore;<br>
but they were read with none the less avidity. Its first mail reached<br>
Buffalo in 1803, on horseback. Mail went thither bi-weekly till 1806,<br>
then weekly. Postal rates were high, ranging for letters from six cents<br>
for thirty miles to twenty-five for four hundred and fifty miles or<br>
over. So late as 1796 New York City received mails from North and from<br>
South, and sent mails in both directions, only twice weekly between<br>
November 1st and May 1st, and but thrice weekly the rest of the year. In<br>
1794 the great cities enjoyed carriers, who got two cents for each<br>
letter delivered. In 1785 there were two dailies, The Pennsylvania<br>
Packet and The New York Advertiser, but, as yet, no Sunday paper<br>
appeared, nor any scientific, religious, or illustrated journal, nor any<br>
devoted to literature or trade. The New York Medical Repository began in<br>
1797, the first scientific periodical in America. In 1801 seventeen<br>
dailies existed. Paper was scarce and high, so that appeals were<br>
published in most of the news sheets imploring people to save their<br>
rags.<br>

<br>
The press was more violently partisan and indecently personal than now.<br>
To oppose the federalist United States Gazette the republican National<br>
Gazette had been started, which, with brilliant meanness, assailed not<br>
only Washington's public acts, but his motives and character. Him, and<br>
still more Adams, Hamilton, and the other leading Federalists, it, in<br>
nearly every issue, charged with conspiracy to found a monarchy.<br>
<br>
Republican journals reeked with such doggerel as:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "See Johnny at the helm of State,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head itching for a crowny;<br>
&nbsp; He longs to be, like Georgy, great,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pull Tom Jeffer downy."<br>
<br>
[Footnote: 2 McMaster, 383]<br>
<br>
Federalists were not behind in warfare of this sort. Jefferson was the<br>
object of their continual and vilest slander. In New England, the<br>
stronghold of Federalism, nearly every Sunday's sermon was an<br>
arraignment of the French, and impliedly of their allies, the<br>
Republicans. [Footnote: 2 McMaster, 383] From Jefferson's election--he<br>
was a conservative free-thinker--they seemed to anticipate the utter<br>
extermination of Christianity, though the man paid in charities, mostly<br>
religious, as for Bibles, missionaries, chapels, meeting-houses, etc.,<br>
one year of his presidency, $978.20; another year, $1,585.60. One<br>
preacher likened the tribute which Talleyrand demanded of Adams's envoys<br>
to that which Sennacherib required of Hezekiah. [Footnote: Isaiah, 36]<br>
Another compared Hamilton, killed in a duel, to Abner, the son of Ner,<br>
slain by Joab. Another took for his text the message which Hezekiah sent<br>
to the Prophet Isaiah: "This is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of<br>
contumely," [Footnote: Isaiah, 37: 3 seq.] etc. Another attacked<br>
Republicanism outright from the words: "There is an accursed thing in<br>
the midst of thee, O Israel." [Footnote: Joshua. 7: 13] The coolest<br>
federalist leaders could fall prey to this partisan temper. Lafayette<br>
meditated settling in this country. Such was his popularity here that no<br>
one would have dared to oppose this openly. Hamilton, however, while<br>
favoring it publicly, yet, lest the great Frenchman's coming should help<br>
on the republican cause, secretly did his utmost to prevent it. Even<br>
Washington, who was human after all, connived, it seems, at this piece<br>
of duplicity.<br>
<br>
According to a federalist sheet, Hamilton's death called forth "the<br>
voice of deep lament" save from "the rancorous Jacobin, the scoffing<br>
deist, the snivelling fanatic, and the imported scoundrel." "Were I<br>
asked," said an apologist, "whether General Hamilton had vices, in the<br>
face of the world, in the presence of my God, I would answer, No."<br>
<br>
Another poetized of the<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Great day<br>
&nbsp; When Hamilton--disrobed of mortal clay--<br>
&nbsp; At God's right hand shall sit with face benign,<br>
&nbsp; And at his murderer cast a look divine."<br>
<br>
In 1800 instrumental music might have been heard in some American<br>
churches. There were Roman Catholic congregations in Boston, New York,<br>
Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Baltimore had its Catholic bishop. The<br>
Protestant Episcopal Church in America had been organized. Methodism,<br>
independent of England since 1784, was on its crusade up and down the<br>
land, already strong in New York and the South, and in 1790 a Methodist<br>
church had been gathered in Boston.<br>
<br>
The manufacture of corduroys, bed-ticking, fustian, jeans, and<br>
cotton-yarn had been started. Iron ore and iron ware of nearly all sorts<br>
was produced. Syracuse was manufacturing salt. Lynn already made morocco<br>
leather, and Dedham, straw braid for hats. Cotton was regularly exported<br>
in small quantities from the South. In New York one could get a decayed<br>
tooth filled or a set of false teeth made. Four daily stages ran between<br>
New York and Philadelphia. The Boston ship Columbia had circumnavigated<br>
the globe. The United States Mint was still working by horse-power, not<br>
employing steam till 1815. Whitney's cotton-gin had been invented in<br>
1793. Terry, of Plymouth, Conn., was making clocks. There were in the<br>
land two insurance companies, possibly more. Cast-iron ploughs, of home<br>
make, were displacing the old ones of wood. Morse's "Geography" and<br>
Webster's "Spelling-book" were on the market, and extensively used.<br>

The great industrial inventions which were to color the entire<br>
civilization of mankind had a powerful effect upon America. So early as<br>
1775, in England, Crompton's mule-jenny had superseded Hargreaves'<br>
spinning machine. The latter had improved on the old spinning-wheel by<br>
making eight, and later eighty, threads with the effort and time the old<br>
arrangement had required for one; but the threads were no better, and<br>
could be used only for woof, linen being required for warp. Arkwright's<br>
roller arrangement was an improvement upon Hargreaves'. It bettered the<br>
quality of the threads, making them evener, so that they could serve for<br>
warp as well as woof. Crompton's mule was another quantitative<br>
improvement, combining the excellences of both Hargreaves and Arkwright.<br>
One man could with this machinery work twenty-two hundred spindles, and<br>
they went much faster than by the ancient wheel. Then came steam-power.<br>
Watts's engine was adapted to spinning and carding cotton at Manchester<br>
in 1783. Two years later the cylinder printing of cottons was invented,<br>
and a little after began the use of acid in bleaching.<br>

<br>
These mighty industrial devices did not cross to America immediately,<br>
but were all here before the time of which we now write. A<br>
spinning-jenny was indeed exhibited in Philadelphia so early as 1775.<br>
During the Revolution, Philadelphia was a seat of much manufacture. We<br>
have in an earlier chapter remarked that Beverly, Mass., had a cotton<br>
factory in 1787. Oxen furnished its power, as a horse did that for the<br>
first Philadelphia mill. A cotton mill was also started very early at<br>
Worcester, but whether in 1780 or 1789 may admit of doubt. There is some<br>
evidence that before July, 1790, a cotton factory run by water, with<br>
ginning, carding, and spinning machines, the last of eighty-four<br>
spindles apiece, was in operation near Statesburg, S. C.; but whether it<br>
was successful or not is not known. Oliver Evans was operating a<br>
single-flue boiler for steam-power by 1786. Soon after he had one with<br>
two flues, and in 1779 a high-pressure or non-condensing engine, the<br>
principle of which he is by many believed to have invented. He was the<br>
earliest builder of steam-engines in the United States, having in 1804<br>
secured a patent for the high-pressure device. His factory furnished<br>
engines to all parts of the country.<br>
<br>
England did her best to prevent all knowledge of the new manufacturing<br>
machinery from crossing the Atlantic. The Act 21 George III., c. 37,<br>
denounced upon anyone who should aid toward giving America any tool,<br>
machine, or secret relating to manufacture in any branch, a penalty of<br>
200 pounds and one year's imprisonment. In vain. Partly by smuggling,<br>
partly by invention, the new arts soon flourished here as there. Some<br>
Scotch artisans who came to Bridgewater, Mass., by invitation from Mr.<br>
Hugh Orr, of that town, constructed, about 1786, the first<br>
cotton-spinning machines in America, including the Arkwright inventions.<br>
<br>
To build and launch the English machinery with full success was,<br>
however, reserved for Samuel Slater, a native of Belper, Derbyshire,<br>
England, who, in 1790, erected at Pawtucket, R. I., the Old Mill in rear<br>
of Mill Street, which still stands and runs. Slater had served his time<br>
at the making of cotton-manufacturing machinery with J. Strutt, who, had<br>
been Arkwright's partner. In Strutt's factory he had risen to be<br>
overseer. So thoroughly had he mastered the business that, on arriving<br>
here, he found himself able to imitate the foreign machines from memory<br>
alone, without model, plan, or measurement. Having gotten his gear in<br>
readiness, almost solely with his own hands, December 20, 1790, he<br>
started three cards, drawing and roving, also seventy-two spindles, all<br>
on the Arkwright plan, the first of the kind ever triumphantly operated<br>
on this side of the ocean. President Jackson styled Slater "the father<br>
of American manufactures," and 1790 may be taken as the birth-year of<br>
the American factory system.<br>
<br>
The Tariff, the embargo policy of President Jefferson, and the hatred<br>
toward England, taking form in organizations pledged to wear only<br>
home-made clothing, all powerfully stimulated the erection of factories.<br>
A report in 1810, of Albert Gallatin, Madison's Secretary of the<br>
Treasury, states that by the end of the year preceding, eighty-seven<br>
cotton factories had arisen in this country, calculated for eighty<br>
thousand spindles. The power loom, however, not used in England till<br>
about 1806, did not begin its work here till after the War of 1812.<br>

CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
DEMOCRACY AT THE HELM<br>
<br>
[1801]<br>
<br>
By the original mode of election, President and Vice-President could not<br>
be separately designated on electors' tickets, so that, soon as party<br>
spirit led each elector to vote for the same two men, these two were<br>
tied for the first place. This occurred in 1801. The republican<br>
candidates were Jefferson and Burr. Each had the same number of<br>
electoral votes, seventy-three, against sixty-five for Adams, sixty-four<br>
for C. C. Pinckney, and one for John Jay. There being no choice, the<br>
election went to the House. This had a federalist majority, but was, by<br>
the parity of the two highest candidates, constitutionally shut up to<br>
elect between these, both of them Republicans. Jefferson as the abler<br>
and from the South, was more than Burr an object of federalist hate.<br>
Against Hamilton's advice, to his honor be it remembered, the<br>
Federalists agreed to throw their votes for Burr. But the vote then, as<br>
to-day in such a case, had to be by States. There were sixteen States,<br>
nine being necessary to a choice. In nineteen ballots on February 11th,<br>
nine the 12th, one the 13th, four the 14th, one each the 16th and 17th,<br>
thirty-five in all, Jefferson every time carried eight States and Burr<br>
six, while Maryland and Vermont were equally divided, and therefore<br>
powerless.<br>
<br>
The fear at last began to be felt that the Union would go to pieces and<br>
the Federalists be to blame. Accordingly, on the 36th ballot, five<br>
Federalists from South Carolina, four from Maryland, one from Vermont,<br>
and one from Delaware--Mr. Bayard, grandfather to President Cleveland's<br>
first Secretary of State--did not vote, enabling the republican members<br>
from Vermont and Maryland to cast the votes of those States for<br>
Jefferson. Thus, with ten States, he was elected, Burr becoming<br>
Vice-President. This crisis led, in 1804, to the XIIth Amendment to the<br>
Constitution, which directs each elector to vote for Vice-President as<br>
such. There can hardly now be a tie between the two leading presidential<br>
candidates, and if there is for any reason delay in electing the<br>
President, the Senate may proceed to elect the Vice-President at once.<br>
The improvement became manifest when, in 1825, the House again had to<br>
elect the President, and chose John Quincy Adams over Crawford and<br>
Jackson.<br>
<br>

Stuart--property of T. Jefferson Coolidge.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
The Democratic Party proved to have entered upon a long lease of power.<br>
For forty years its hold upon affairs was not relaxed, and it was in no<br>
wise broken even by the elections of Harrison in 1840 and Taylor in<br>
1848. Nor did it ever appear probable that the Whigs, upon anyone of the<br>
great issues which divided them from the Democrats, were in a way to win<br>
permanent advantage. Not till after 1850 had the ruling dynasty true<br>
reason to tremble, and then only at the rise of a new party, the modern<br>
Republicans, inspired by the bold cry of anti-slavery, which the Whigs<br>
had never dared to raise.<br>
<br>
As to its main outlines, the democratic policy was well foreshadowed in<br>
Jefferson's first inaugural. It favored thrift and simplicity in<br>
government, involving close limitation of army, navy, and diplomatic<br>
corps to positive and tangible needs. It professed peculiar regard for<br>
the rights and interests of the common man, whether of foreign or of<br>
native parentage. Strict construction of the Constitution, which was to<br>
a great extent viewed as a compact of States, was another of its<br>
cherished ideas. It also maintained special friendliness for agriculture<br>
and commerce. From its strict constructionism sprung, further, its<br>
hostility to internal improvements; from this and from its regard to<br>
agriculture and commerce resulted its dislike to restrictive tariffs.<br>
Particularly after the whig schism, about 1820, did these ideas stand<br>
forth definite and pronounced as the authoritative democratic creed. In<br>
and from Jackson's time they were more so still.<br>
<br>
Yet in most respects Jefferson has remained the typical Democrat, He had<br>
genuine faith in the people, in free government, in unfettered<br>
individuality, His administration was frugal almost to a fault. He<br>
insisted upon making the civil power supreme over the military, and<br>
scorned all pretensions on the part of any particular class to rule, In<br>
two points only was his democracy ideal rather than illustrative of that<br>
which followed, viz., adroitness in giving trend and consistency to<br>
legislation, and non-partisan administration of the civil service. In<br>
the former no executive has equalled him, in the latter none since<br>
Quincy Adams.<br>
<br>
Growing up as a scholar and a gentleman-farmer, with refined tastes,<br>
penning the great Declaration, which was early scouted for its<br>
abstractions, long minister to France, where abstract ideas made all<br>
high politics morbid, the sage of Monticello turned out to be one of the<br>
most practical presidents this nation has ever had. If he overdid<br>
simplicity in going to the Capitol on horseback to deliver his first<br>
inaugural, tying his magnificent horse, Wildair, to a tree with his own<br>
hands, he yet entertained elegantly, and his whole state as President,<br>
far from humiliating the nation, as some feared it would, was in happy<br>
keeping with its then development and nature. His cabinet, Madison,<br>
Gallatin, Dearborn, Smith, and Granger, was in liberal education<br>
superior to any other the nation has ever had, every member a college<br>
graduate, and the first two men of distinguished research and<br>
attainments.<br>
<br>
As to the civil service, Jefferson, it is true, made many removals from<br>
office, some doubtless unwise and even unjust; but in judging of these<br>
we must remember his profound and unquestionably honest conviction that<br>
the Federalists lacked patriotism. It was this belief which dictated his<br>
prosecution, almost persecution, of Burr, whom Federalists openly<br>
befriended and defended.<br>
<br>
<br>

Aaron Burr.<br>
From a painting by Vallderlyn at the New York Historical Society.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aaron Burr was the brilliant grandson of President Edwards. Graduating<br>
at Princeton at the early age of seventeen, he studied theology a year,<br>
then law, which on the outbreak of the Revolution he deserted for army<br>
life at Boston. He went in Arnold's expedition to Canada, was promoted<br>
to be colonel, and served on Washington's staff. In Canada he did<br>
service as a spy, disguised as a priest and speaking French or Latin as<br>
needed. His legal studies completed, 1783 found him in practice in New<br>
York, office at No. 10 Little Queen Street. Both as lawyer and in<br>
politics he rose like a meteor, being Hamilton's peer in the one, his<br>
superior in the other. Organizing his "Little Band" of young<br>
Republicans, spite of federalist opposition and sneers from the old<br>
republican chiefs, he became Attorney-general of New York in 1789. In<br>
1791, superseding Schuyler, he was United States senator from that<br>
State, and in 1800, Vice-President.<br>
<br>
Higher he could not mount, as federalist favor cursed him among his own<br>
party, yet was too weak to aid him independently. It was kept down by<br>
Hamilton, who saw through the man and opposed him with all his might.<br>
For this Burr forced him to a duel, and fatally shot him, July 11, 1804.<br>
<br>
Indicted for murder, Burr now disappears from politics, but only to<br>
emerge in a new role. During all the early history of our Union the<br>
parts beyond the Alleghanies were attached to it by but a slender<br>
thread, which Spanish intrigue incessantly sought to cut. At this very<br>
time Spain was pensioning men in high station there, including General<br>
Wilkinson, commanding our force at New Orleans. Could not Burr detach<br>
this district or a part of it from our Government and make here an<br>
empire of his own? Or might he not take it as the base of operations for<br>
an attack on Spanish America that should give him an empire there? Some<br>
vision of this sort danced before the mad genius's vision, as before<br>
that of Hamilton in the Miranda scheme. Many influential persons<br>
encouraged him, with how much insight into his plan we shall never know.<br>
Wilkinson was one of these. Blennerhassett, whose family and estate Burr<br>
irreparably blasted, was another. He expected aid from Great Britain,<br>
and from disaffected Mexicans.<br>
<br>
From the outset the West proved more loyal than he hoped, and when, at<br>
the critical moment, Wilkinson betrayed him, he knew that all was lost.<br>
Sinking his chests of arms in the river near Natchez, he took to the<br>
Mississippi woods, only to be recognized, arrested by Jefferson's order,<br>
and dragged to Richmond to jail. As no overt act was proved, he could<br>
not be convicted of treason; and even the trial of him for misdemeanor<br>
broke down on technical points. The Federalists stood up for Burr as if<br>
he had been their man, while Jefferson on his part pushed the<br>
prosecution in a fussy and personal way, ill becoming a President.<br>
<br>
Jefferson's most lasting work as national chief-magistrate was his<br>
diplomacy in purchasing for the Union the boundless territory beyond the<br>
Mississippi, prized then not for its extent or resources, both as yet<br>
unknown, but as assuring us free navigation of the river, which sundry<br>
French and Spanish plots had demonstrated essential to the solid loyalty<br>
of the West. Louisiana, ceded by France to Spain in 1762, became French<br>
again in 1801. Napoleon had intended it as the seat of a colonial power<br>
rivalling Great Britain's, but, pressed for money in his new war with<br>
that kingdom, concluded to sell. He wished, too, the friendship of the<br>
United States against Great Britain, and knew not the worth of what he<br>
was bargaining away. Willing to take fifty million francs, he offered<br>
for one hundred million, speedily closing with Livingston and Monroe's<br>
tender of eighty, we to assume in addition the French spoliation claims<br>
of our citizens. The treaty of purchase was signed May 2, 1803, and<br>
ratified by the Senate the 17th of the following October.<br>
<br>
This stupendous transaction assured to our Republic not only leading<br>
hand in the affairs of this continent, but place among the great powers<br>
of the world. Its 1,124,685 square miles doubled the national domain. It<br>
opened path well toward, if not to, the Pacific, and made ours<br>
measureless tracts of agricultural and mining lands, rich as any under<br>
the sun.<br>

<br>
If it originated many of the most perplexing questions which have<br>
agitated our national politics, as those relating to slavery in this<br>
territory itself, to the acquisitions from Mexico, to the Pacific<br>
railways, and to the Indians and the Chinese, all this has been amply<br>
compensated by the above and countless other benefits.<br>
<br>
Equally brilliant if less impressive was another piece of Jefferson's<br>
foreign policy. He might be over-friendly to France, but elsewhere he<br>
certainly did not believe in peace at any price. The Barbary powers had<br>
begun to annoy our commerce soon after Independence. The Betsey was<br>
captured in 1784, next year the Maria, of Boston, and the Dauphin, of<br>
Philadelphia, and their crews of twenty-one men carried to a long and<br>
disgraceful captivity in Algiers.<br>

The Dey's bill for these captives, held by him as slaves, was:<br>

Later a single cruise lost us ten vessels to these half-civilized<br>
people.<br>
<br>
Following European precedent, Washington had made, in 1795, a<br>
ransom-treaty with this nest of pirates, to carry out which cost us a<br>
fat million. The captives had meantime increased to one hundred and<br>
fifteen, though the crews of the Maria and the Dauphin had wasted away<br>
to ten men. Nearly a million more went to the other North-African<br>
freebooters. The policy of ransoming was, indeed, cheaper than force.<br>
Count d'Estaing used to say that bombarding a pirate town was like<br>
breaking windows with guineas. The old Dey of Algiers, learning the<br>
expense of Du Quesne's expedition to batter his capital, declared that<br>
he himself would have burnt it for half the sum.<br>
<br>
Yet it makes one's blood hot to-day to read how our fathers paid tribute<br>
to those thieves. The Dey had, in so many words, called us his slaves,<br>
and had actually terrorized Captain Bainbridge, of the man-of-war George<br>
Washington, into carrying despatches for him to Constantinople, flying<br>
the Algerine pirate flag conspicuously at the fore. After<br>
anchoring--this was some requital--Bainbridge was permitted to hoist the<br>
Stars and Stripes, the first time that noble emblem ever kissed the<br>
breeze of the Golden Horn.<br>
<br>
[1803]<br>
<br>
Jefferson loathed such submission, and vowed that it should cease.<br>
Commodore Dale was ordered to the Mediterranean with a squadron to<br>
protect our ships there from further outrage. One of his vessels, the<br>
Experiment, soon captured a Tripoli cruiser of fourteen guns, the<br>
earliest stroke of any civilized power for many years by way of showing<br>
a bold front to these pestilent corsairs.<br>
<br>
This was on August 6, 1801. In 1803 Preble was placed in command of the<br>
Mediterranean fleet, with some lighter ships to go farther up those<br>
shallow harbors. Bainbridge had the misfortune while in pursuit of a<br>
Tripoli frigate to run his ship, the Philadelphia, on a rock, and to be<br>
taken prisoner with all his crew. The sailors were made slaves.<br>
Lieutenant Decatur penetrated the Tripoli harbor under cover of night,<br>
and burned the Philadelphia to the water's edge. Tripoli was bombarded,<br>
and many of its vessels taken or sunk. Commodore Barron, who had<br>
succeeded Preble, co-operated with a land attack which some of the<br>
Pasha's disaffected subjects, led by the American General Eaton, made<br>
upon Tripoli. The city was captured, April 27th, and the pirate prince<br>
forced to a treaty. Even now, however, we paid $60,000 in ransom money.<br>

CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
THE WAR OF 1812<br>
<br>
[1807]<br>
<br>
Although paying, so long as Jay's treaty was in force, for certain<br>
invasions of our commerce, Great Britain had never adopted a just<br>
attitude toward neutral trade. She persisted in loosely defining<br>
contraband and blockade, and in denouncing as unlawful all commerce<br>
which was opened to us as neutrals merely by war or carried on by us<br>
between France and French colonies through our own ports.<br>
<br>
The far more flagrant abuse of impressment, the forcible seizure of<br>
American citizens for service in the British navy, became intolerably<br>
prevalent during Jefferson's administration. Not content with reclaiming<br>
deserters or asserting the eternity of British citizenship, Great<br>
Britain, through her naval authorities, was compelling thousands of men<br>
of unquestioned American birth to help fight her battles. Castlereagh<br>
himself admitted that there had been sixteen hundred bona fide cases of<br>
this sort by January 1, 1811. And in her mode of asserting and<br>
exercising even her just claims she ignored international law, as well<br>
as the dignity and sovereignty of the United States. The odious right of<br>
search she most shamefully abused. The narrow seas about England were<br>
assumed to be British waters, and acts performed in American harbors<br>
admissible only on the open ocean. When pressed by us for apology or<br>
redress, the British Government showed no serious willingness to treat,<br>
but a brazen resolve to utilize our weak and too trustful policy of<br>
peace.<br>
<br>
One instance of this shall suffice. Commodore Barron, in command of the<br>
United States war vessel Chesapeake, was attacked by the Leopard, a<br>
British two-decker of fifty guns, outside the mouth of Chesapeake Bay,<br>
to recover three sailors, falsely alleged to be British-born, on board.<br>
Their surrender being refused, the Leopard opened fire. The Chesapeake<br>
received twenty-one shots in her hull, and lost three of her crew killed<br>
and eighteen wounded. She had been shamefully unprepared for action, and<br>
was hence forced to strike, but Humphreys, the Leopard's commander,<br>
contemptuously declined to take her a prize. There was no excuse<br>
whatever for this wanton and criminal insult to our flag, yet the only<br>
reparation ever made was formal, tardy, and lame.<br>

James Madison.<br>
From a painting by Gilbert Stuart--property of T. Jefferson Coolidge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bad was changed to worse with the progress of the new and more desperate<br>
war between Great Britain and Napoleon. The Emperor shut the<br>
North-German ports to Britain; Britain declared Prussian and all West<br>
European harbors in a state of blockade. The Emperor's Berlin decree,<br>
November, 1806, paper-blockaded the British Isles; his Milan decree,<br>
December, 1807, declared forfeited all vessels, wherever found,<br>
proceeding to or from any British port, or having submitted to British<br>
search or tribute. In fine, Britain would treat as illicit all commerce<br>
with the continent, France all with Britain. But while Napoleon, in<br>
fact, though not avowedly, more and more receded from his position,<br>
England maintained hers with iron tenacity.<br>
<br>
[1810]<br>
<br>
Sincere as was our Government's desire to maintain strict neutrality in<br>
the European conflict, it naturally found difficulty in making England<br>
so believe. Their opponents at home ceaselessly charged Jefferson,<br>
Madison, and all the Republicans with partiality to France, so that<br>
Canning and Castlereagh were misled; and they were confirmed in their<br>
suspicion by Napoleon's crafty assumption that our embargo or<br>
non-intercourse policy was meant to act, as it confessedly did,<br>
favorably to France. Napoleon's confiscation of our vessels, at one time<br>
sweeping, he advertised as a friendly proceeding in aid of our embargo.<br>
Yet all this did not, as Castlereagh captiously pretended, prove our<br>
neutrality to be other than strict and honest. At this time it certainly<br>
was both. So villainously had Napoleon treated us that all Americans now<br>
hated him as heartily as did any people in England.<br>
<br>
[1812]<br>
<br>
The non-intercourse mode of hostility, a boomerang at best, had played<br>
itself out before Jefferson's retirement; and since George's ministry<br>
showed no signs whatever of a changed temper, guiltily ill-prepared as<br>
we were, no honorable or safe course lay before us but to fight Great<br>
Britain. Clay, Calhoun, Quincy Adams, and Monroe--the last the soul of<br>
the war--deserved the credit of seeing this first and clearest, and of<br>
the most sturdy and consistent action accordingly. Their spirit proved<br>
infectious, and the Republicans swiftly became a war party.<br>
<br>
Most of the "war-hawks," as they were derisively styled, were from the<br>
South and the southern Middle States. Fearing that, if it were a naval<br>
war, glory would redound to New England and New York, which were hotbeds<br>
of the peace party, they wished this to be a land war, and shrieked, "On<br>
to Canada." They made a great mistake. The land operations were for the<br>
most part indescribably disgraceful. Except the exploits of General<br>
Brown and Colonel Winfield Scott, subsequently the head of the national<br>
armies, not an action on the New York border but ingloriously failed.<br>
The national Capitol was captured and burnt, a deed not more disgraceful<br>
to England in the commission than to us in the permission. Of the<br>
officers in command of armies, only Harrison and Jackson earned laurels.<br>
<br>
Harrison had learned warfare as Governor of Indiana, where, on November<br>
7, 1811, he had fought the battle of Tippecanoe, discomfiting Tecumseh's<br>
braves and permanently quieting Indian hostilities throughout that<br>
territory. In the new war against England, after Hull's pusillanimous<br>
surrender of Detroit, the West loudly and at length with success<br>
demanded "Tippecanoe" as commander for the army about to advance into<br>
Canada. Their estimate of Harrison proved just. Overcoming many<br>
difficulties and aided by Perry's flotilla on Lake Erie, he pursued<br>
Proctor, his retreating British antagonist, up the River Thames to a<br>
point beyond Sandwich. Here the British made a stand, but a gallant<br>
charge of Harrison's Kentucky cavalry irreparably broke their lines. The<br>
Indians, led by old Tecumseh in person, made a better fight, but in<br>
vain. The victory was complete, and Upper Canada lay at our mercy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 382px; height: 485px;" alt="" src="images/341Pic.jpg"><br>
Tecumseh<br>
<br>
<br>
Andrew Jackson also began his military experience by operations against<br>
Indians. The southern redskins had been incited to war upon us by<br>
British and Spanish emissaries along the Florida line. Tecumseh had<br>
visited them in the same interest. The horrible massacre at Fort Mims,<br>
east of the Alabama above its junction with the Tombigbee, was their<br>
initial work. Five hundred and fifty persons were there surprised, four<br>
hundred of them slain or burned to death. Jackson took the field, and in<br>
an energetic campaign, with several bloody engagements, forced them to<br>
peace. By the battle of the Horse-Shoe, March 27, 1814, the Creek power<br>
was entirely crushed.<br>
<br>
Subsequently placed in command of our force at New Orleans, Jackson was<br>
attacked by a numerous British army, made up in large part of veterans<br>
who had seen service under Wellington in Spain. Pakenham, the hero of<br>
Salamanca, commanded. Jackson's position was well chosen and strongly<br>
fortified.&nbsp; After several preliminary engagements, each favorable
to the<br>
American arms, Pakenham essayed to carry the American works by storm.<br>
The battle occurred on January 8, 1815. It was desperately fought on<br>
both sides, but at its close Jackson's loss had been trifling and his<br>
line had not been broken at a single point, while the British had lost<br>
at least 2,600, all but 500 of these killed or wounded. The British<br>
immediately withdrew from the Mississippi, leaving Jackson entirely<br>
master of the position.<br>
<br>
But the naval operations of this war were far the most famous, exceeding<br>
in their success all that the most sanguine had dared to hope, and<br>
forever dispelling from our proud foe the charm of naval invincibility.<br>
The American frigate Constitution captured the British Guerriere. The<br>
Wasp took the Frolic, being soon, however, forced to surrender with her<br>
prize to the Poitiers, a much larger vessel. The United States<br>
vanquished the Macedonian, and the Constitution the Java. One of the<br>
best fought actions of the war was that of McDonough on Lake Champlain,<br>
with his craft mostly gunboats or galleys. His victory restored to us<br>
the possession of Northern New York, which our land forces had not been<br>
able to maintain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 424px; height: 516px;" alt="" src="images/344Pic.jpg"><br>
Oliver H, Perry.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1813-1814]<br>
<br>
The crowning naval triumph during the war, one of the most brilliant, in<br>
fact, in all naval annals, was won by Oliver Hazard Perry near<br>
Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie, September 10, 1813, over the Briton, Barclay, a<br>
naval veteran who had served under Nelson at Trafalgar. The fleets were<br>
well matched, the American numbering the more vessels but the fewer<br>
guns. Barclay greatly exceeded Perry in long guns, having the latter at<br>
painful disadvantage until he got near. Perry's flag-ship, the Lawrence,<br>
was early disabled. Her decks were drenched with blood, and she had<br>
hardly a gun that could be served. Undismayed, Perry, with his insignia<br>
of command, crossed in a little boat to the Niagara. Again proudly<br>
hoisting his colors, aided by the wind and followed by his whole<br>
squadron, he pressed for close quarters, where desperate fighting<br>
speedily won the battle. Barclay and his next in command were wounded,<br>
the latter dying that night. "We have met the enemy and they are ours,"<br>
Perry wrote to Harrison, "two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one<br>
sloop."<br>
<br>
Triumph far more complete might have attended the war but for the<br>
perverse and factious federalist opposition to the administration. Some<br>
Federalists favored joining England out and out against Napoleon. Having<br>
with justice denounced Jefferson's embargo tactics as too tame, yet when<br>
the war spirit rose and even the South stood ready to resent foreign<br>
affronts by force, they changed tone, harping upon our weakness and<br>
favoring peace at any price. Tireless in magnifying the importance of<br>
commerce, they would not lift a hand to defend it. The same men who had<br>
cursed Adams for avoiding war with France easily framed excuses for<br>
orders in council, impressment, and the Chesapeake affair.<br>
<br>
Apart from Randolph and the few opposition Republicans, mostly in New<br>
York, this Thersites band had its seat in commercial New England, where<br>
embargo and war of course sat hardest, more than a sixth of our entire<br>
tonnage belonging to Massachusetts alone. From the Essex Junto and its<br>
sympathizers came nullification utterances not less pointed than the<br>
Virginia and Kentucky resolutions, although, considering the sound<br>
rebukes which the latter had evoked, they were far less defensible.<br>
Disunion was freely threatened, and actions either committed or<br>
countenanced bordering hard upon treason. The Massachusetts Legislature<br>
in 1809 declared Congress's act to enforce embargo "not legally<br>
binding." Governor Trumbull of Connecticut declined to aid, as requested<br>
by the President, in carrying out that act, summoning the Legislature<br>
"to interpose their protecting shield" between the people and "the<br>
assumed power of the general Government." "How," wrote Pickering,<br>
referring to the Constitution, Amendment X., "are the powers reserved to<br>
be maintained, but by the respective States judging for themselves and<br>
putting their negative on the usurpations of the general Government?" A<br>
sermon of President Dwight's on the text, "Come out from among them and<br>
be ye separate, saith the Lord," even Federalists deprecated as hinting<br>
too strongly at secession. This unpatriotic agitation, from which, be it<br>
said, large numbers of Federalists nobly abstained, came to a head in<br>
the mysterious Hartford Convention, at the close of 1814, and soon began<br>
to be sedulously hushed--in consequence of the glorious news of victory<br>
and peace from Ghent and New Orleans.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
While the Congregationalists, especially their clergy, were nearly all<br>
stout Federalists, opposing Jefferson, Madison, and the war, the<br>
Methodists and Baptists almost to a man stood up for the administration<br>
and its war policy with the utmost vigor, rebuking the peace party as<br>
traitors. [Footnote: The writer's grandfather, a Baptist minister, was<br>
as good as driven from his pulpit and charge at Templeton, Mass.,<br>
because of his federalist sympathies in this war.] Timothy Merritt, a<br>
mighty Methodist preacher on the Connecticut circuit, has left us from<br>
these critical times a stirring sermon on the text, Judges v. 23, "Curse<br>
ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants<br>
thereof; because they came not up to the help of the Lord, to the help<br>
of the Lord against the mighty." Meroz was the federalist party and<br>
England's ministry and army were "the mighty."<br>
<br>
Czar Alexander, regarding our hostility as dangerous to England, with<br>
whom he then stood allied against Napoleon, sought to end the war. The<br>
Russian campaign of 1812 practically finished Napoleon's career, so<br>
leaving England free to press operations in America. In April, 1814,<br>
Paris was captured. The United States therefore accepted Alexander's<br>
offices. Our commissioners, Adams, Clay, Gallatin, Marshall, Bayard, and<br>
Russell met the English envoys at Ghent, and after long discussions, in<br>
which more than once it seemed as if the war must proceed, the treaty of<br>
Ghent was executed, December 24, 1814, a fortnight before the battle of<br>
New Orleans.<br>
<br>
It was an honorable peace. If we gained no territory we yielded none.<br>
The questions of Mississippi navigation and the fisheries were expressly<br>
reserved for future negotiations. Upon impressment and the abuse of<br>
neutrals, exactly the grievances over which we had gone to war, the<br>
treaty was silent, and peace men laughed at the war party on this<br>
account, calling the war a failure. The ridicule was unjust. Had<br>
Napoleon been still on high, or the negotiations been subsequent to the<br>
New Orleans victory, England would doubtless have been called upon to<br>
renounce these practices. But experience has proved that such a demand<br>
would have been unnecessary. No outrage of these kinds has occurred<br>
since, nor can anyone doubt that it was our spirit as demonstrated in<br>
the war of 1812 which changed England's temper. Hence, in spite of our<br>
military inexperience, financial distress, internal dissensions, and the<br>
fall of Napoleon, which unexpectedly turned the odds against us, the war<br>
was a success.<br>
